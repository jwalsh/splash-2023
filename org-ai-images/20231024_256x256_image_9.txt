Image Prompt: A haunting image of Sally, the child laborer, sitting in front of a surreal amalgamation of a cotton gin and a computer terminal. Her hands, replaced with cybernetic attachments, work furiously against the fluorescent glow of her work station. The otherwise dark and oppressive textile mill is occasionally illuminated by bolts of synthetic lightning.
