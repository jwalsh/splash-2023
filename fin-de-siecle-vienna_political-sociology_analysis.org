* Introduction 

The article presented is 'Politics in a new key' by Carl E. Schorske, a respected historian known for his work on intellectual and cultural history. Schorske outlines the crucial socio-political changes which occurred in Vienna at the turning of the last century, focusing especially on the burgeoning movement of anti-liberal political parties and the shifting nature of the social elite. 

* Summary and Explanation 

The article tracks Vienna's break away from liberal politics into the arms of a more populist right-wing party led by Karl Lueger, a change largely motivated by the rising middle class's dissatisfaction with the liberalism's limitations. While previous political systems had been grounded in societal structure (guilds, social hierarchia, etc.), a new political body - the Christian Social Party - encouraged public dissent and held a populist appeal that added a fresh dimension to traditional politics. 

According to Schorske, this change represented a radical shift from politics based on a class hierarchy to judging individuals on their personal merit (their knowledge, expertise, etc.). This shift, coming at a time when Vienna was already undergoing massive cultural and societal transformation, was an unexpected movement. 

* Evidence and Results Evaluation

Evidence for Vienna's shift to populist right-wing politics come from a variety of sources including newspaper articles, speeches from key political figures like Lueger, party manifestos, and population census data. The Christian Social Party's rise to power under Lueger was evident in their sweeping victory in the 1897 elections. Other sources of evidence include the change in public opinion towards Jews, immigrants, and other previously disenfranchised groups, reflecting a shift in societal attitudes. 

The rise of the Christian Social Party under Lueger marked the birth of modern populist politics. However, while this was a significant change, Schorske points out that the impact was not all positive. The populist approach promoted nationalistic sentiments and xenophobia, contributing to social division and the eventual collapse of Habsburg monarchy. 

* Practicality, Limitations, Caveats

However, Schorske's argument, though convincing, is subject to some limitations. Notably, this transformation puts an emphasis on Vienna, ignoring to an extent the broader context within which this political shift is occurring. The growth of nationalism and right-wing populism was not exclusive to Vienna but was a part of a broader regional trend across Europe. 

Moreover, the paper's focus on the male experience of the shift also limits our understanding. The perspective of women, immigrants, and other minority classes is not thoroughly explored, which would likely further our understanding of the complexities of this societal transformation.

Despite these caveats, Schorske's work remains fundamental and thought-provoking, weaving an evocative account of the socio-political changes of fin-de-si√®cle Vienna. It helps us appreciate that political shifts are rarely single-threaded or linear, but rather, they are multi-dimensional, often unexpected, and invariably complex.

* Consequences for Human Destiny 

The article serves as a potent reminder that societal and political shifts can occur unexpectedly and often result in monumental changes that can drastically alter human destiny. The rise of right-wing populism and the decline of liberalism in Vienna changed the political landscape not just of the city, but also of Europe and, eventually, the world.

Schorske's work also underscores the importance of considering a variety of perspectives and dimensions when trying to understand the complex nature of societal changes and the importance of being vigilant of these societal shifts so that we can respond proactively to curb potentially harmful consequences.

* Model, Code or Simulation 

The evidence for this work is primarily historical and sociological, requiring extensive research and synthesis rather than code or simulation. As such, a computational model or simulation in Clojure or any other language would not be appropriate. 

For this type of analysis, quantitative techniques such as archival research, content analysis, and potentially even network analysis (to visualise complex relationships between various political parties, for example) would be more beneficial than the traditional coding or simulations.
