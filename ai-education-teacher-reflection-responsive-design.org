The central premise of the article under review is the vital role of teacher reflection and responsive design in artificial intelligence (AI) systems intended for educational purposes. The authors argue that educators’ voice and their reflective practice need to be core principles in the design of AI systems in education. They stress that ignoring the needs and perspectives of teachers can lead to limited adoption and misuse of AI solutions.

Evidence derives from various sources, including literature reviews, case studies, and the authors’ own design experiences in developing AI education solutions. The authors identify several practical guidelines for incorporating teachers' reflective practice into the AI systems' design process. Those guidelines include incorporating teachers' expertise into AI system development directly, co-designing AI systems with teachers, and creating AI solutions that respect teachers' autonomy.

However, the authors acknowledge several limitations to their arguments. First, the implementation of their guidelines strongly depends on diverse teaching contexts. Strategies that work in one context might not work in another. Second, there is limited empirical evidence regarding the practicality of their proposed guidelines. Further research is needed to validate and expand on their ideas.

Despite these limitations, the authors argue that their insights have critical implications for the future of AI and education. If AI design does not sufficiently consider teachers' expertise and autonomy, the technology could be used in ways that undermine the professional role of teachers, thus posing serious ethical and practical issues.

While much of the discussion aligns with current literature on AI and education, one surprising argument is the authors' emphasis on the potential misuse of AI in education if teachers' perspectives are not considered in the design process.

*** Impact 

The findings of this paper have considerable potential to shape the future of AI in education. The authors suggest that understanding and respecting teacher autonomy and reflection can enhance the development and use of AI tools, potentially leading to more effective teaching practices. However, if designers fail to consider teachers' perspectives, AI could be used in ways that undermine the professional role of teachers, with far-reaching implications for educational practices and policies.

*** Code

Certain aspects of the authors' arguments can be implemented in code. For example, to develop an AI tool that respects teacher autonomy, system designers could provide customizable models that could be tweaked according to individual teachers' needs. Clojure code example:

#+begin_src clojure
(def customizable-model
     (fn [parameters]
        (create-model-with parameters)))

(def teacher-use-case 
     (customizable-model {:learning-style "kinesthetic" :range "intermediate"}))
#+end_src

*** Questions

1. How can teacher perspectives be effectively integrated into AI system design in diverse teaching contexts?
2. How can AI tools be designed to ensure they respect and enhance the autonomy of teachers?
3. What are the ethical, societal, and pedagogical implications of potential misuse of AI in education if teacher perspectives are not given enough weight in the design process?
