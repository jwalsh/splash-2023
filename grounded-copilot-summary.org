*** Summary

The paper entitled "Grounded Copilot: How Programmers Interact with Code-Generating Models" examines how artificial intelligence (AI) can assist software developers in creating code, particularly focusing on the tool called GitHub Copilot. The authors, within a seven-month analysis period, observed and evaluated how users engage with AI-powered autocompletion in the development environment.

Key points can be delineated as follows:

- The study has been built on thousands of hours of rich telemetry data generated by developers.
- The investigation discovers four categories of interactivity between programmers and GitHub Copilot: passive interaction, feedback loop, scaffold building, and conversational programming.
- The integrated machine-centered learning model, Codex, translates developers’ natural language and contextual coding to suggest relevant code.
- The tool generates suggestions for unfamiliar languages, infers from context, helps learn new APIs, and forms an integral part of code review.

*** Impact

Arendt would likely emphasize that GitHub Copilot converts programming from an entirely human-made construct to a symbiosis with artificial intelligence, altering the nature of coding. The coders' role shifts from purely generating to also curating AI-produced output, yet, it is essential to ensure that the programmer retains control.

The study, however, also reveals the limitations of the tool:

- It can mindlessly propagate code from the data it was trained on, including bugs or deprecated practices.
- It lacks an understanding of legality or ethics – copying code without crediting sources, or suggesting illegal or harmful functions.
- It sometimes overgeneralizes from its training data, leading to incorrect suggestions. 

While this generates efficiency and optimizes resource use, adopting AI tools uncritically may result in losing grip over the accessible knowledge of code generation. Furthermore, these sorts of AI-platforms rely on large-scale computation and energy usage that could lead to broader environmental implications.

*** Code

#+begin_src clojure

;; Here's a trivia code example for fun:
;; A function that uses Github Copilot could potentially look like this:

(defn github-copilot-magic
  [context]
  (let [codex-model (load-model "Codex")
        suggestion (generate-suggestion codex-model context)]
    (if (acceptable? suggestion)
      (use-suggestion suggestion)
      (undo-and-try-again))))

#+end_src

In this function, a context is provided to Codex, GitHub Copilot's underlying model. Codex then generates a code suggestion, which is either used if acceptable or rejected and tried again.

*** Questions

1. How might programmers maintain control over their code while still fully utilizing AI tools such as GitHub Copilot?
2. Given the potential propagation of bugs and deprecated practices by the tool, what structures need to be put in place to ensure that AI-generated code is efficient and reliable?
3. Considering ethics and legality in code generation, how might GitHub Copilot be improved for better understanding and abiding by these aspects?
