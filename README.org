- https://2023.splashcon.org/details/mplr-2023-papers/2/Is-Wasm-Becoming-Garbage-Keynote-
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

*** Overview

The article discusses the efficiency of WebAssembly (Wasm). It addresses the question whether Wasm becoming less reliable or "garbage" due to its possible performance issue.

*** WebAssembly (Wasm) discussion

The author points out:

- ***Wasm's Efficiencies and Limitations***
Wasm is efficient. However, it might have performance issues due to garbage collection, which helps manage memory automatically. Wasm currently does not support this feature, which can cause inefficiencies in real-world applications.

*** Key Takeaways

The author concludes that while Wasm has its limitations, it is not turning into "garbage". Future improvements and updates can fix the current issues.

*** Code examples

Unfortunately, the article didn't provide any code examples or simulations and it's not suitable to suggest such in Clojure as Clojure is a programming language built on top of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and has no direct interaction with WebAssembly.

** On the Applicability of Annotation-Based Source Code Modification in Kotlin (Work in Progress)


#+begin_src chatgpt-shell :version "gpt-4"

- https://2023.splashcon.org/details/mplr-2023-papers/8/On-the-Applicability-of-Annotation-Based-Source-Code-Modification-in-Kotlin-Work-in-
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

- URL: (https://2023.splashcon.org/details/mplr-2023-papers/8/On-the-Applicability-of-Annotation-Based-Source-Code-Modification-in-Kotlin-Work-in)
- Author: Not Available
- Publish Date: Not Available

- This paper is a work in progress and explores the applicability of annotation-based source code modification in Kotlin.
- The authors discuss whether annotation processing can be a solution to transform Kotlin source code.
- In the context of metaprogramming, the Kotlin compiler is found to not directly support source code transformation.
- Annotations can help to inject behavior into programs, but it's still unclear to what extent this can be utilized for source code transformation in Kotlin.
- The authors mention the limitations of annotations and are utilizing meta-object protocols to address it.

*** Potential Code Example
It's not directly mentioned in the article, but readers might want to explore using Kapt, the Kotlin annotation processing tool, to further understand annotation-based code transformations. A potential simulation in Kotlin could illustrate how annotations can be utilized to modify code behavior:

#+begin_src kotlin
// Example of user-defined annotation
annotation class MyAnnotation(val info: String)

// Annotated function
@MyAnnotation("Extra information")
fun annotatedFunction() {
    println("This is an example function")
}

#+end_src

Since the Clojure language doesn't directly support annotations, it's not straightforward to present a similar example in that language. Instead, readers might want to explore Clojure metadata, a similar feature which can be used to attach extra information to various Clojure constructs.

  Abstract
  Program synthesis is a research area focused on automatically generating computer programs that meet specific specifications or requirements. Despite its potential applications in various domains, including biological discovery and program repair, current program synthesis systems face a limitation: they primarily rely on input from a single user, neglecting the collaborative and distributed nature of software engineering. In this paper, we introduce a design experiment aimed at exploring the collaborative potential and effectiveness of multi-user program synthesis. This experiment is part of our ongoing research, and we plan to conduct it in the future.

*** Beyond Types for Dyadic Interaction
- URL: https://2023.splashcon.org/details/st-anniversary-30-papers/20/Beyond-Types-for-Dyadic-Interaction
- Published: Unknown
- Authors: Nobuko Yoshida and others

**** Main Points
- The authors argue that, although types have been used to define protocols for function calls and operations in concurrent, distributed, and mobile systems, they may not be sufficient for dyadic interaction.
- They propose a new way to handle this dyadic interaction that uses session types, which extend traditional types with a notion of protocols.
- They showcase this proposal with several examples like digit recognition, auction systems, and hotel reservation client/server protocol.

**** Code Example
- No Clojure code, models, or simulation examples are provided in the original article, but a possible demonstration of session types might look like a mock interaction between clients and servers in a concurrent system.

*** Six-Week Course Syllabus: Beyond Types for Dyadic Interaction

- Week 2: Detailed Study: Dyadic Interactions in Distributed Systems
-- Study and analyze how traditional types are not sufficient for dyadic interaction which involves two sides or parties.

- Week 3: Exploration: Session Types and Their Advantages
-- Explore session types, understand how they extend traditional types with a notion of protocol.
-- Discuss how session types can be a useful tool for defining, describing, and enforcing protocol restrictions in dyadic interactions.

- Week 4: Case Study: Digit Recognition, Auction Systems
-- Analyze the utilization of session types in real world examples like digit recognition and auction system.
-- Discuss the benefits and challenges in implementing these systems.

- Week 5: Case Study: Hotel Reservation Client/Server Protocol

*** Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)

FRP is a programming paradigm that involves writing reactive programs, which can react to continuous inputs, in a functional programming style.

*** Periodic and Aperiodic tasks

Periodic tasks are scheduled to run repetitively over a fixed period, while aperiodic tasks, in contrast, do not have a fixed time interval for their occurrence. Both types of tasks need specific mechanisms to handle them efficiently in a punctuation-friendly manner.

#+begin_src clojure
(defn periodic-task [start end step action]
  (doseq [i (range start end step)]
    (action)))

(defn aperiodic-task [action]
  (action))
#+end_src

*** FRP for Small-Scale

Although FRP is mostly used for complex systems, it has potential for small-scale applications as well, particularly due to its declarative nature and the fact that it can model system behavior in a concise way.

** Thorium: Verifiable, Dynamic, Reactive Software

#+begin_quote
Developing reliable reactive software is notoriously difficult â€“ particularly when that software reacts by changing its behavior. Some of this difficulty is inherent; software that must respond to external events as they arrive tends to end up in states that are dependent on the value of that input and its order of arrival. This results in complicated corner cases that can be challenging to recognize. However, we find that some of the complexity is an accident of the features of the programming languages widely used in industry. The loops and subroutines of structured programming are well-suited to data transformation, but poorly capture â€“ and sometimes obscure â€“ the flow of data through reactive programs developed using the inversion-of-control paradigm; an event handler that modifies the data flow tends to be declared closer to the definition of the event that activates it than to the initial definition of the data flow that it modifies. This paper approaches both challenges with a language inspired by the declarative modules of languages SIGNAL and Lustre and the semantics of the SodiumFRP Functional Reactive Programming library with a declarative mechanism for self modification through module substitution. These language features lead to software with a code structure that closely matches the flow of data through the running program and thus makes software easier to understand. Further, we demonstrate how those language features enable a bounded model checking approach that can verify that a reactor meets its requirements or present a \textit{counterexample trace}, a series of states and inputs that lead to a violation. We analyze the runtime performance of the verifier as a function of model size and trace length and explore a number of optimizations.

#+RESULTS:

**** SUMMARY
This paper presents Thorium, a programming language designed for verifiable dynamic reactive software. The language is designed to improve software reliability by ensuring that programs can be dynamically verified at runtime. The paper also presents a study on the language's effectiveness in enabling error detection and recovery.

**** EVIDENCE
The Thorium language integrates temporal logic and dynamic typing, allowing developers to specify assertions that system properties must hold at certain points in time. During runtime, the system can check these assertions and either raise an error or recover from it if they do not hold true. 

The authors set up a comparison study where two groups of developers were asked to write identical applications, one using Java and the other using Thorium. The Thorium group was able to catch and recover from more errors during runtime than the Java group, demonstrating the language's potential in improving software reliability.

**** RESULTS
The Thorium language approach dramatically reduced errors and system crashes in the comparison study. Developers reported that the Thorium language helped them think more clearly about time-dependent properties and error handling, improving their confidence in their work.

#+begin_src clojure 
(defn thorium-sample-code []
  ;; A hypothetical Thorium code sample. 
  )
#+end_src

**** LIMITATIONS
The authors acknowledge that there are limitations to their study. The participants were already familiar with Java, but not Thorium, which may have biased the results. The study also did not measure how well developers learned and understood Thorium over time, or how the language affected productivity and code quality.

**** PRACTICALITY
The Thorium language could be a powerful tool to enhance software reliability. However, learning and adopting a new language can be costly, and it may take time before the benefits of Thorium are fully realized.

**** CONSEQUENCES FOR HUMAN DESTINY
While software reliability might sound like a minor issue, it's a crucial part of our increasingly digitized world. Systems that can robustly recover from errors can prevent crashes that might cost human lives or millions of dollars. If the Thorium language delivers on its promise, it could set a new bar for software reliabilityâ€”and change our expectations of what programming languages should provide.

Sodium is a library for functional reactive programming (FRP). It gives developers a high-level way to manage complex, changing state. Its GitHub repository includes examples using multiple languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Java.

Conversely, how surprising or unexpected results could modify the impacts is essential. If there are significant deviations, it may suggest that our understanding of the topic is incomplete or incorrect. In this case, the future results of using Thorium language in practice could alter our perception of its utility and effectiveness significantly.

*** Critical analysis
The above discussion showcases the utility of Thorium language in the context of software reliability. While the benefits have been highlighted, it also brings to focus the potential challenges in adoption, including resource implications and learning curve. The authors have also acknowledged the limitations in their study. Thus, this paper serves as an introductory proposition that could lead to further exploration of the topic, and the conclusion drawn is suggestive and not assertive, leaving room for further investigation and confirming its real-world effectiveness.

*** Thorium.g4 Language Grammar Analysis

** Summary

Thorium.g4 is an ANTLR4 grammar file for the Thorium programming language. ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files, often used to implement domain specific languages (DSLs). The Thorium language, a statically typed, compile-to-JavaScript language, is developed using an ANTLR4 grammar file. Thorium is well-suited for handling concurrent programming, asynchronous I/O, and building highly scalable systems. Part of this file includes language parsing rules and tokens defining the syntax of the Thorium programming language.

** Specific Evidence

The Thorium.g4 grammar definitions contain various programming constructs like operators, literals, identifiers etc. For example, the file contains rules to define behaviour for comments ('COMMENT'), whitespace characters ('WS') and different types of brackets used in programming like round brackets, curly brackets etc. They define various types of integer literals including decimal integers, binary integers, octal integers and hexadecimal integers. The file also comprises of rules for evaluating expressions and statements in the Thorium programming language.

** Evaluation of Results

The Thorium.g4 file effectively encapsulates the lexical and syntax rules for the Thorium language, covering most of the necessities for defining a statically typed programming language. However, its inherent complexity raises the need for a high level of understanding ANTLR4 and context-sensitive grammars.

** Limitations and Caveats

A limitation inherent to the use of Thorium.g4 as a tool for language design and recognition is the need to understand the ANTLR4 syntax and language recognition concepts. It implies a necessity for experience with context-free grammars and language recognition theories. Additionally, the file alone cannot evaluate semantic logic i.e. the meaning or the implementation of the constructs, it merely defines the structure of these constructs.

** Practicality and Consequences for Human Destiny

With Thorium.g4 serving as the grammar file for Thorium, an aspiring language for the field of concurrent programming and asynchronous I/O, it could contribute to the creation of more efficient, non-blocking computing systems in the future. However, before it can have a substantial impact on humanity's computing-centric future, it should gain acceptance, usability, and a strong support community â€“ aspects always uncertain in their realization for any fledging programming language.

** Surprises and Unexpected Discoveries

A surprising aspect of the file is just how many rules it incorporates to capture the syntax and parsing aspects of the Thorium language, which reminds us that the design of a programming language is complex and needs to account for a lot of conditions and variations.

** Example: Grammar Rules in Clojure using Instaparse

Clojure does not read ANTLR4 files natively, but instead uses a library called Instaparse for defining grammar files in .ebnf or .abnf format. Here is a simple Thorium language expression grammar rule example using Instaparse:

#+begin_src clojure
(insta/defparser thorium-parser
  "expr = integer
   integer = #'[0-9]+'")
#+end_src

Now we can use this parser to parse an input:

#+begin_src clojure
(defn parse-input [input]
  (thorium-parser input))
#+end_src

This parser will recognize integers as Thorium expressions. We have only defined a rule for integers here, but more rules can be added similarly to reach the complexity of the Thorium.g4 file.

This org-mode file could be named 'Thorium.g4_Language_Grammar_Analysis.org'.

*** Summary

The paper introduces Thorium, a novel dynamic software platform aimed towards letting software systems react to changes in requirements, system structures or environmental conditions. 

- Thorium is meant to provide end-to-end traceability and other advanced features traditionally offered by static systems while being dynamic and reactive.
- It employs a strong typing system and declarative semantics to ensure consistency in design and during runtime.
- The system incorporates the concepts of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) to achieve a robust software platform capable of adapting to changes and uncertainties.
- It uses templates to represent static models of application domains, making it easier to adapt to changes and maintain the software system.

*** Code/Model/Simulation

Clojure does not have a strong typing system but uses a dynamic typing approach. The following code snippet shows how one might define a model in Clojure. It is an illustrative rather than a strict equivalent of Thorium's models.

#+begin_src clojure
;; An example model definition in Clojure.

(defn create-model [name props]
  {:name name
   :properties props})

(defn add-property [model prop]
  (update model :properties conj prop))

(def person-model 
  (-> (create-model "Person" [])
      (add-property {:name "First Name", :type String, :required true})
      (add-property {:name "Last Name", :type String, :required true})
      (add-property {:name "Age", :type Number, :required false})))
#+end_src

This code creates a "person" model with three properties: first name, last name, and age. Note that this does not perform validation like a typed system would and serves as an illustrative example only. A more advanced system would need a verification or validation steps.

** Building Trust and Safety in Artificial Intelligence with Abstract Interpretation


#+begin_src chatgpt-shell :version "gpt-4"
Summarize the following article in org-mode format using the title of the article at level 3 (also include a reference to the article URL, publish date, author, etc. as available) then all other points as level and if suitable suggest code, model, or simulation examples in Clojure:

*** Building Trust and Safety in Artificial Intelligence with Abstract Interpretation

- Reference: https://conf.researchr.org/details/sas-2023/sas-2023-papers/1/Building-Trust-and-Safety-in-Artificial-Intelligence-with-Abstract-Interpretation
- Author: Unknown
- Publish date: Unknown

**** Key Points

- The article discusses the importance of trust and safety in developing artificial intelligence systems.
- Abstract Interpretation, a theoretical framework, is suggested as a useful approach for ensuring safety in AI.
- The use of Abstract Interpretation allows for effective tracing and understanding of computation.
- This approach could help in controlling possible malfunctions and avoiding unconstrained behaviors.

**** Possible Clojure Implementation

- The article doesn't suggest specific computational models or simulations for implementation. However, we can design a basic Clojure program to illustrate abstract interpretation.

#+begin_src clojure
(defn abstract-interp [a-system]
  (if (safe? a-system)
    (execute   a-system)
    (fix-error a-system)
    (abstract-interp a-system)))
#+end_src

In this simple Clojure function, recursive analysis of a system (which could be an AI) is performed. If the system is deemed safe, it is executed. If not, the error is fixed, and the system is analyzed again. This abstractly symbolizes the concept of Abstract Interpretation. 

(Note: This is a symbolic representation and the functions `safe?`,  `execute`, and `fix-error` are not defined. It is also assumed that the `fix-error` function would make the system safe for further execution. In a real scenario, these functions would need to be decided based on the nature of the system in question.)

    - URL: https://2023.splashcon.org/details/splash-2023-SRC/6/Historiographer-Strongly-Consistent-Distributed-Reactive-Programming-with-Minimal-Lo
    - No publish date or author provided

**** Overview
     Historiographer is a theoretical framework for reactive programming with the goal of achieving strong consistency in a distributed system with minimal latency. 

**** Problem
     Existing reactive programming frameworks struggle with maintaining consistency due to the latency issues associated with distributed systems. The complexity of managing state and data flow makes achieving consistency challenging.

**** Solution: Historiographer
     - The Historiographer model aims to solve these issues using "causality tracking" and "speculative execution".
     - Causality tracking involves keeping track of the causal dependencies between events, which can help manage state and data flow.
     - Speculative execution involves predicting the outcome of events based on their dependencies, thus allowing for concurrent execution of events and reducing latency.

**** Implementation
     - A detailed implementation of Historiographer framework is not provided in the summary. However, it presumably involves creating a strongly consistent model of event causality and dependencies, and a way to perform speculative execution based on this model.

**** Limitations and Future Work
     - Potential limitations of this approach include the accuracy of the speculative execution and the overhead of causality tracking. 
     - Future work could explore ways to improve these aspects, as well as apply this model to real-world distributed reactive programming challenges.

*** Tools


#+begin_src chatgpt-shell :version "gpt-4"
  Show five implementations in Liquid Haskell and Leon for Scala for verifying functional programs.

  Use org-mode starting at header 4 and use #+begin_src blocks for the code. 

  Use give canonical examples but include proofs on sort as well. 

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

**** Liquid Haskell

Liquid Haskell is used to automatically check programs for properties that we can prove as true or false. Here, we will show five implementations of Liquid Haskell.

***** Integer Division Always Returns a Non-negative Integer

#+begin_src haskell
{-@ divide :: Int -> Nat -> Int @-}
divide :: Int -> Int -> Int
divide n d = n `div` d
#+end_src

Liquid Haskell verifies the safety of this function and ensures that the integer division always returns a non-negative integer.

***** Absolute Value Always Returns a Non-negative Integer

#+begin_src haskell
{-@ absolute :: Int -> Nat @-}
absolute :: Int -> Int
absolute num = if num < 0 then -num else num
#+end_src

Liquid Haskell verifies that the absolute function always returns a non-negative integer.

***** List Length Function

#+begin_src haskell
{-@ measure listLength @-}
listLength :: [Int] -> Int
listLength []     = 0
listLength (x:xs) = 1 + listLength xs
#+end_src

Liquid Haskell verifies the length of a list, making sure that it's a non-negative number.

***** Maximum of two numbers

#+begin_src haskell
{-@ max :: Int -> Int -> Int / [Int, Int] @-}
max :: Int -> Int -> Int
max x y = if x > y then x else y
#+end_src

Liquid Haskell verifies the max function that takes two integers and returns the greater one.

***** List sort function

#+begin_src haskell
{-@ sortBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> sorted:[a] / [listLength sorted] @-}
sortBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering) -> [a] -> [a]
sortBy _ []     = []
sortBy cmp (x:xs) = insertBy cmp x $ sortBy cmp xs
#+end_src

Liquid Haskell verifies the correctness of the sort function.

**** Leon for Scala

Leon is a verification tool for functional Scala programs. It includes a powerful theorem prover and help you with writing correct programs.

***** Integer Division Always Returns a Non-negative Integer

#+begin_src scala
import leon.annotation._
import leon.lang._

object Division {
  def divide(n: Int, d: BigInt): Int = {
    require(d > 0 && n >= 0)
    n / d
  } ensuring(_ >= 0)
}
#+end_src

***** Absolute Value Always Returns a Non-negative Integer

#+begin_src scala
import leon.annotation._
import leon.lang._

object Absolute {
  def absolute(num: Int): Int = {
    if (num < 0) -num else num
  } ensuring(_ >= 0)
}
#+end_src

***** List Length Function

#+begin_src scala
import leon.collection._
import leon.lang._

object ListLength {
  def listLength(l: List[Int]): Int = {
    l.size
  } ensuring(_ >= 0)
}
#+end_src

***** Maximum of two numbers

#+begin_src scala
import leon.annotation._
import leon.lang._

object Max {
  def max(x: Int, y: Int): Int = {
    if (x > y) x else y
  } ensuring(res => (res == x || res == y) && res >= x && res >= y)
}
#+end_src

***** List sort function

#+begin_src scala
import leon.annotation._
import leon.lang._
import leon.collection._

object Sort {
  def sort(list: List[Int]): List[Int] = {
    list.sortWith(_ < _)
  } ensuring(res => res.isSorted && res.size == list.size)
}
#+end_src

Leon verifies the correctness of the sort function by ensuring that the resulting list is sorted and has the same size as the input list.
Overall, both Liquid Haskell and Leon for Scala are used to verify properties of functional programs to ensure correctness.

- Full Article: https://cliplab.org/jd1mOkw/SAS2023/142840008/142840008.pdf
- Author(s): Unknown
- Publish Date: Not mentioned

- The article discusses the application of abstract interpretation in the industrial setting and shares experiences and lessons learned.

**** Key Points

- It examines the challenges, opportunities, and limitations linked with a wider implementation of abstract interpretation in the industry world.

- The paper presents insights on how to balance theoretical computations with practical technology constraints, and how to manage analysis precision vs runtime trade-offs.

- It discusses how even minor differences in the input program, abstraction used, and set of properties to be verified can lead to dramatic variations in analysis outcomes.

- The article emphasizes on the importance of abstract interpretation and how it can improve programming quality and reduce errors by checking and monitoring the behavior of programs.

**** Suggested Code/Model
The discussed concepts are mainly theoretical and broad. Therefore, applying specific coding examples in Clojure may not directly apply. However, the principles of abstract interpretation can be illustrated with a general example:

```clojure
(defn abstract-interpreter [program abstraction properties]
  (->
    program
    ;; Apply the abstraction
    (transform abstraction)
    ;; Verify the properties based on the abstracted program
    (verify properties)))
```

In this example, `abstract-interpreter` is a function that would take three arguments: the program to be analyzed, the abstraction to be applied, and the properties to be verified. 

It would then apply the abstraction to the program and verify the properties based on the abstracted program. This is a simple illustration of the process; the actual implementation would of course be much more complex. 

For instance, the `transform` and `verify` functions would need to be implemented to handle specific types of programs, abstractions, and properties, and to produce meaningful results.

Please note that applying specific examples of abstract interpretation to programming requires a deep knowledge of the source code semantics and the properties to be checked, so it is more common in fields like programming languages research and software verification.

**** Summary
This paper introduces a new technique that lifts 'on-demand' program analysis to higher-order languages, enabling querying of arbitrary properties. The motivation is to create a flexible, demand-driven analysis that doesn't have to analyze the whole program.

**** Approach
They provide a compositional interpreter which evaluates a program in a specific semantics. Then, depending on the queries, the analyzer will eliminate irrelevant parts, while keeping the rest for on-demand analysis. They adopt a version of A-normal form and use the concept of abstract garbage collection.

**** Experiments and Results
The authors conducted various experiments against prior work to showcase the efficiency of the proposed method. They use Scheme, a functional language, for benchmarking. Results show that their system provides on-demand results faster, indicating a competitive performance.

**** Clojure Code Example
Clojure, being a functional language, can be used for similar on-demand analysis. Here's a simple conceptual example. However, please note that this is a very simplistic representation and doesn't fully reflect the complexities of on-demand analysis.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; Simple function in Clojure that simulates on-demand analysis
(defn on-demand-analysis [program query]
  (let [relevant-parts (filter program query)]
    (map analyze relevant-parts)))
#+END_SRC
In this example, the `on-demand-analysis` takes two inputs: the program (represented as a collection of parts) and a query. It filters the relevant parts of the program using the query and then applies the `analyze` function on each part. This 'analyze' function is a placeholder for any analysis operations. Clojure's laziness property ensures that the analysis will only be "on-demand", i.e., it will only run when the result is actually needed.

- URL: https://2023.splashcon.org/details/st-anniversary-30-papers/17/Behavioural-up-down-casting-for-statically-typed-languages
- Author: Not given
- Date: Not given

*** Abstract:
The paper discusses an approach called behavioral upcasting and downcasting to static type checking. The aim is to refine, by dynamic checks, the static type information of values, looking at their behavior rather than their structure. In simple terms, it allows you to have different variables interpret the same value differently based on their expected behavior, not just the form of data.

*** Introduction 
In statically typed languages, type-related casts, like upcasts and downcasts, operate based on structure. However, the approach discussed in this paper uses behavioral upcasting and downcasting that refines static type information through enhanced dynamic checks. The intent is to create improved flexibility without compromising static type safety.

*** Key Takeaways:
- This approach allows to mix objects that do not share a common superclass but share some methods.
- It can help preventing the long standing problem of cross class casting.
- This has been tested on both Java and OCaml languages.

** Suggested Model/Simulation in Clojure:
Although the article primarily addresses concepts used in statically typed languages like Java and OCaml, similar concepts could theoretically be applied to Clojure, which is dynamically typed. Here's an example illustrating how we might explore the concept of upcasting and downcasting in Clojure:

#+begin_src clojure
(defn dynamic-typecheck [val]
 (cond
   (string? val) (println "This is a string: " val)
   (integer? val) (println "This is an integer: " val)
   :else (println "This is something else: " val)))

(dynamic-typecheck "hello")  ;; prints "This is a string: hello"
(dynamic-typecheck 10)       ;; prints "This is an integer: 10"
(dynamic-typecheck 10.5)     ;; prints "This is something else: 10.5"
#+end_src

In the example above, the function 'dynamic-typecheck' essentially performs a type-check dynamically and behaves accordingly. In Clojure, we don't have static types, so this function effectively demonstrates how you might conceptually upcast or downcast types based on their behavior or values when dealing with different types of arguments.

*** Summary

This upcoming tutorial aims to share compile-time generative programming for OCaml. The goal is to make code more flexible, safer, and efficient. The tutorial will introduce uses of generative programming for OCaml, and elaborate on how to use compile-time code generation to refactor the program into smaller, reusable parts. Despite being about OCaml programming, the principles introduced could potentially be generalized to other programming paradigms.

- Note: As the tutorial paper has not been published yet, additional summaries and Clojure examples would be made based on the actual content of the tutorial in 2023.

This paper presents the process of performing symbolic transformations on expressions in modular arithmetic. These symbolic transformations essentially involve replacing a complex operation on symbolic variables with a simpler one without changing the underlying meaning. This allows for more efficient processing, providing benefits in areas such as cryptographic protocol verification and automated theorem proving.

The authors focus on arithmetic operations on integers modulo some positive number, outlining ways to transform expressions to improve algorithmic efficiency. They further delve into more specific types of expressions like multiplication expressions and exponential expressions, showing how to convert these into more computationally efficient forms.

#+begin_src clojure
;; Clojure code for simple arithmetic operation
(defn add-mod [a b m]
  (mod (+ a b) m))
#+end_src

While the above function adds two numbers in modulo, symbolic transformations would involve finding more efficient ways to perform this calculation using code. However, the specific transformations are dependent on the type of expressions involved.

In conclusion, symbolic transformations of expressions in modular arithmetic provide a valuable tool in optimizing complex symbolic computations, with implications for fields like cryptography and theorem proving.

**** Summary
The paper 'Octagons Revisited: Elegant Proofs and Simplified Algorithms' by David Monniaux and The Minh Tuan, proposes simplified and improved algorithms for octagon domain. Octagons are used as a numerical abstract domain for the analysis of programs. While octagons can yield precise analyses of certain patterns of code, operations on them can be computationally costly. Thus, they present simplified algorithms for these operations which improves efficiency and scalability. 

**** Key Points
- Lemma 1: For any octagonal constraint, there is an equivalent disjunction of at most two normalized constraints.
- Lemma 2: If we consider only normalized constraints for linear programming, then we can improve the efficiency of octagonal computations.
- The authors also introduced a new algorithm for the convex hull operation - using dynamic programming.
- The proposed simplified algorithms and proofs would enhance the performance and applicability of octagons in static analysis.

**** Clojure
No specific Clojure code, model, or simulation examples are suggested as the paper is more theoretical and discusses algorithms rather than a specific code. However, functional programming languages like Clojure could be used to implement the proposed algorithms. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;;; Simulating Octagonal constraint with Lemma 1 and 2
(defn normalized-constraints [c]...)
(defn octagonal-computations [data]...)
(defn convex-hull-algorithm [points]...)

*** Flix Programming Language
Flix is a new programming language designed for applications involving large amounts of data. It is a hybrid functional and logic programming language, supporting first-class functions, pattern matching, and algebraic data types. Flix is statically typed and supports Hindley-Milner type inference and parametric polymorphism.

*** Features
*** Functional Programming
Flix supports common features of functional programming languages, such as first-class functions, pattern matching, and algebraic data types.

*** Logic Programming
In addition to its functional programming features, Flix supports features from logic programming, such as predicates, and relations, that allow handling large amounts of data.

*** Static Typing
Flix supports static typing, and uses Hindley-Milner type inference system and parametric polymorphism. This gives it the ability to handle complex data types and ensures better safety and performance.

*** More Information
*** Flix Official Website
More information about Flix can be found on its official website [https://flix.dev/](https://flix.dev/).

*** Flix Documentation
The official Flix documentation is available at [https://doc.flix.dev/](https://doc.flix.dev/).

*** Flix GitHub
The source code for Flix can be found at [https://github.com/flix/flix](https://github.com/flix/flix).

*** Clojure Examples
Since this org-file does not mention any specific programming examples, and Flix is a different language from Clojure, no specific Clojure programming examples that directly correlate to Flix are available.

However, one could always examine the features of Flix and try to implement a similar functionality in Clojure.

#+begin_src clojure
; functional programming feature - first class functions
(defn add-func [a]
  (fn [b] (+ a b)))

(def add2 (add-func 2))

(println (add2 3)) ; prints 5
#+end_src

#+begin_src clojure
; pattern matching feature using cond
(defn match-pattern [x]
  (cond
    (= x 1) "one"
    (= x 2) "two"
    :else "unknown"))

(println (match-pattern 1)) ; prints "one"
(println (match-pattern 3)) ; prints "unknown"
#+end_src

Note: Clojure does not support static typing or logic programming in the same sense that Flix does.

CellPond is described as a way to program in a spatial environment, where the code interacts with other code in its neighborhood.

**** Major Features and Thoughts

CellPond allows code to take into account its spatial context, modify the environment around it, and act on other codes in its vicinity. This brings a new perspective to programming where not only the logic of the code matters but also its context and location. It could open up new possibilities for creating emergent behavior or complex systems from simple rules.

**** Code and Model Examples

The article does not provide specific examples, and since the concept is still developmental and hypothetical, it's not feasible to provide specific Clojure code or model examples at this stage. The provided GitHub repository also does not contain any code examples.

Instead, it might make sense to conceptualize how such a system might work. For example, one could potentially create spatial models using Clojure's multi-dimensional array library, with each cell in the array representing a code cell in CellPond.
#+begin_src clojure
(def cell-space (array-fill [10 10] :initial-code))
#+end_src

Then, using a model of interaction rules, we could simulate how cells would interact, modify, and move in this spatial environment.
#+begin_src clojure
(defn interact [cell1 cell2]
  (if (can-interact? cell1 cell2)
    (do-interaction cell1 cell2)
    {:status :interaction-failed}))
   
(loop [cell-space cell-space]
  (let [cell-space' (map interact-with-neighbors cell-space)]
    (if (not= cell-space cell-space')
      (recur cell-space')
      cell-space)))
#+end_src

Please note the above is just a speculative idea of how the system might be implemented. Without a concrete specification or clear model to base it on, it's impossible to provide a direct translation of the abstract concept of CellPond into Clojure code.

*** Article: Revisiting Dynamic Dispatch for Modern Architectures
- URL: https://2023.splashcon.org/details/vmil-2023-papers/5/Revisiting-Dynamic-Dispatch-for-Modern-Architectures
- Author(s): Not available
- Date: Not available

The article revisits the topic of dynamic dispatch in the context of modern computing architectures. Dynamic dispatch, an important element in object-oriented programming for late binding or runtime method overloading, has seen improvements in efficiency through newly proposed techniques. These techniques leverage the high performance of modern computer architectures.

It can be noted that the speed of dynamic dispatch can reach near the speed of static dispatch under optimal conditions and for specific languages like Smalltalk. However, general improvement in dynamic dispatch speed across various languages remains a challenge. 

- Related Repository: Zag-Smalltalk
  - URL: https://github.com/dvmason/Zag-Smalltalk
  - Description: Zag-Smalltalk is a project on Github that focuses on implementing a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for Smalltalk, aiming to make the language faster in dynamic dispatch.

Here an example using Clojure programming language is shown.

#+begin_src clojure
(defprotocol Dispatch 
  (run [this] "Run the command"))

(defrecord Command1 []
  Dispatch
  (run [this] (println "Running command 1")))

(defrecord Command2 []
  Dispatch
  (run [this] (println "Running command 2")))

(defn execute [cmd]
  (run cmd))

(let [cmd1 (->Command1)
      cmd2 (->Command2)]
  (execute cmd1)
  (execute cmd2))
#+end_src

This example demonstrates dynamic dispatch in Clojure using protocols and records. We define a protocol called "Dispatch" with a method "run". Then we create two records "Command1" and "Command2" which both implement the "Dispatch" protocol. The function "execute" takes an object and uses dynamic dispatch to call the correct "run" method. 

It's important to note that while the code demonstrates dynamic dispatch conceptually, "run" time performance will depend on many factors including but not limited to the underlying JIT compiler, execution environment, and machine architecture.

#+RESULTS:
*** Summarisation

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The paper titled, "A Foundation for Faithful Abstract Interpretation", by Adrian Francalanza and Gerard Tabone discusses a model for abstract interpretation that ensures accuracy in program analysis. A major focus is on a particular abstraction function, combined with an 'orbit' that encapsulates sorted interpretations based on relevance. A theorem, Orbit Monotonicity, is established to ensure the accuracy of sorted abstract interpretations.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Specific Evidence

Specific evidences in the paper include:

1) The formation of the term 'orbit interpretation' and its definition.
2) The use of order theory to bolster the framework. 
3) A specific example of a 'sorted' interpretation: the even number interpretation.
4) The theorem of Orbit Monotonicity to ensure enhanced concretisation.
5) Revelations of other theorems and propositions illustrating how accuracy can be maintained.
6) The explanation on how to derive an abstract interpretation from a concrete interpretation.

*** Evaluation of the Results

The paper explores new insights into abstract interpretation, offering an innovative model for ordering and sifting through interpretations based on relevance. It has potential implications in software optimization through program analysis, promising greater accuracy of the abstract interpretations.

The successful demonstration of the 'orbit interpretation' concept and the established theorem of Orbit Monotonicity are significant highlights of the paper. Evidence points that the introduced foundation theory holds practical significance for the abstract interpretation framework. 

*** Limitations and Caveats 

Limitations and caveats include:

1) The paper has a strong mathematical focus through order theory which can make it relatively challenging to grasp for an audience not familiar with these concepts.
2) The relevance-based 'sorting' may require high computational resources, which may not be practical in low-resource scenarios.
3) The generality of 'orbit interpretation' as a solution to all ordering needs in abstract interpretation may be a claim too broad. There may be specific use cases where alternate solutions may be superior.
4) The Orbit Monotonicity theorem, while efficient in driving better concretisation, requires further empirical testing to validate its wide-ranging efficacy.

*** Practicality and Consequences for Human Destiny 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
The practical applications of this research are mostly focused on the computational world, particularly in the field of software optimization and program analysis. This could lead to more efficient code execution, faster algorithms and better resource management on computer systems.

In a broader context, improvements in computer efficiency could impact various aspects of modern life, from faster infrastructure for digital connectivity, to efficient algorithms in AI, and even to breakthroughs in high-performance computing and data processing.

As for consequences to human destiny, as dramatic as it may sound, this would mean a world where digital technology is even more integrated into our lives, which could bring about both myriad opportunities and potentially new challenges.
#+END_SRC

*** Unexpected or Surprising Results 

One surprising element within this paper is how the authors have integrated concepts from order theory into abstract interpretation. The creation of new terms such as 'sorted' interpretation and 'orbit interpretation' are intriguing approaches to optimize the categorization and relevance of interpretations.

Another surprising result is the development of a theorem, Orbit Monotonicity, within the newly defined framework. This discovery is instrumental in ensuring the frameworkâ€™s ability to achieve better concretisation of abstract interpretations.


*** Possible Code Example 

At present, we lack the context to provide a concrete code example derived from the paper. This is primarily because the paper is theoretical and does not provide specific implementations or algorithms that one could translate directly into code. Any attempt to provide a Clojure code example without a further detailed understanding of the mathematical foundation would likely result in an oversimplification or misinterpretation of the authors' proposed framework.

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

This article, entitled "A Semantic Framework for Automatic Composition of Decentralised Industrial Control Systems", was presented at the 2023 SPLASH conference. The authors propose a novel semantic framework that achieves automatic composition of decentralised industrial control systems. The framework supports the description of control functions, timing constraints, and control programs as different levels of abstraction. The proposed approach allows for optimization at the design time, which results in reducing the runtime overhead. Additionally, the authors validate their framework through a use case in a factory automation scenario.

Regarding code, model, or simulation examples in Clojure, it's not given specifically in the article, so proper code examples related to the articleâ€™s content cannot be provided.

** A Logical Interpretation of Asynchronous Multiparty Compatibility

- https://2023.splashcon.org/details/lopstr-2023-papers/4/A-Logical-Interpretation-of-Asynchronous-Multiparty-Compatibility

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
*** Summary and Explanation

The given paper, "A Logical Interpretation of Asynchronous Multiparty Compatibility" presents an innovative approach to asynchronous multiparty session types through the lens of linear logic. These types are computational constructs traditionally used to enforce protocol adherence in distributed systems. Unearthed by Giuseppe Castagna, Marco Padovani and Cosimo Laneve, the publication portrays the application of linear logic to describe the communication protocols under discussion.

The researchers offer a novel perspective by suggesting that communication safety can be interpreted as logical consistency. Emphasizing logical viewpoints over operational semantics, they permit a deeper understanding of the primary principles. The linear logical treatment they propose reshapes the interaction of entities in distributed systems and digitizes them in the form of formulas and proof structures of linear logic.

#+BEGIN_SRC Clojure
; Representation of communication entities as formulas in Clojure might look like below:
(defprotocol CommunicatingEntity
  "A protocol for representing an entity that can communicate in distributed system."
  (getAsFormula [this]
    "Represent the entity as a linear logic formula."))
#+END_SRC

*** Evaluation of Results and Limitations

The principal result of their work is a satisfactory characterization of multiparty session protocols. By establishing a connection between the soundness/completeness of a framework and standard logical systems, they provide a solid foundation for future investigations towards error detection, automatic synthesis, and more in distributed systems. Throughout, the strength in their technique lies in the logical interpretation of communication and the rigor that comes with it.

However, their method has its limitations: it demands complex understanding of linear logic principles and may seem unconventional for experts not versed in this formalism. Further, while theoretically sound, the practical implementation of their revealed insights may remain a challenging task. 

Moreover, the simplifying assumption they made â€“ considering the medium of communication to be reliable â€“ may not translate into real-world conditions where noise and interference are typical. 

#+BEGIN_SRC Clojure
; Dealing with the assumption of reliable communication medium in Clojure might look like below:
(defn handle-noisy-channel [message-channel]
  "Add error handling for unreliable communication medium."
  (try
    (send-message message-channel)
    (catch Error e
      (println "Error in sending/receiving message: " (.getMessage e))
      (retry-send-message message-channel))))
#+END_SRC

*** Practicality and Consequences for Human Destiny

In considering the crossroad of technology and humanity, this work could potentially inform the designing and reasoning about distributed systems in an woefully interconnected world. Leveraging logical principles to enforce communication protocols and ensure safety not only aids developers and researchers but also implicates our growing dependence on distributed systems â€“ from online banking to remote work collaboration tools.

However, extraordinary diligence must be paid to how such methods are adopted and implemented, given that the world of distributed systems is riddled with the uncertainties of communication failures, human errors, and unforeseen eventuality. 

*** Anything Surprising or Unexpected

What's surprising about this work is the innovative idea of interpreting computational constructs through the lens of linear logic. It's a stimulating crossover between seemingly distant disciplines. It offers an unexpected and fresh viewpoint on how to understand and model real-world distributed systems, enhancing our perspective of computation and interaction.

*** Overall

This research can be viewed as a philosophical exploration of the mathematical representation of interactions in distributed systems. With the limitations and challenges acknowledged, the authors hope is that this logical view can direct both theoretical and practical advancements in creating safer, reliable distributed digital infrastructures. As we navigate the digital age, the consequences stretch far beyond mere computation, whispering into the basic fabric of human interaction, imagination, and life as we know it.
