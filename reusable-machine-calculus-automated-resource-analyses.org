*3 Summary and Evaluation of Automated Resource Analysis using Reusable Machine Calculus*

In essence, this particular study provides insight into the effective utilization of a reusable machine calculus (RMC) for devising automated resource analyses. This novel machine calculus proves to be an efficient tool for conducting an assessment of non-functional properties, hence facilitating effective program analysis. 

The researchers, for theoretical verification, implement a Coq machine calculus prototype. The evidence for the performance of this RMC is presented by the evaluation of ten different resource analyses. The domains covered in these analyses are varied, ranging from execution time to security-centric assessments like secrecy analyses. 

*3.1 Theoretical Verification*

However, this intricate world of resource analysis inherently possesses certain limitations. It is worth stressing that the task of defining machine calculus frequently tends to be tedious and error-prone, primarily owing to its low-level semantic nature. As a result, it frequently inhibits the growth of complex analyses.

*3.3 Practicality and Impact on Human Destiny*

The constant endeavour to simplify and automate resource analysis has profound implications for our future as humans. By integrating this reusable machine calculus into our technology, we may achieve greater efficiency and accuracy, eliminating human error and saving valuable time. This has the potential to greatly accelerate advancements in a variety of fields, manifesting in unimagined ways and determining the destiny of humankind.

*3.4 Unexpected Findings*

One surprising facet is the apparent discrepancy between the practicality of RMC and the perceived complexity of defining machine calculus.
