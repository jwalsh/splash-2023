The scholarly article titled "Live Pattern Matching with Typed Holes" presents a novel pattern-matching system that has been improved with so-called 'typed holes', in order to boost interactive programming experiences. A core argument in the paper is that the pervasive lack of documentation and opaque type error messages have made existing pattern-matching systems hard to understand and thereby, difficult to use. The authors propose a solution that integrates pattern-oriented programming with live feedback and type-guided development.

Specifically, the authors present a sound and complete algorithm for pattern type checking and inhabitation. They further describe the concept of 'typed holes' within the context of interactive programming, which are designed to aid programmers in making sense of the type errors that arise out of mismatched or inconsistent pattern types. By offering live feedback and providing detailed information directly in the coding flow, the system aims to make pattern-matching more accessible and its usage more intuitive.

*** Impact 

The careful work done by the authors promises to address the problems with usability and lack of guidance in pattern-matching systems, making these systems more transparent and their functions evident. The value of enhancing programming with a live, ongoing commentary cannot be overstated â€”it allows programmers to refine their code progressively, instead of at the end of a long, tedious troubleshooting process. Thus, it supports a more efficient coding practice while simultaneously fostering a deeper understanding of the pattern-matching paradigm. 

Despite these potential benefits, it is important to recognize the limitations in the proposal. This approach might demand more computational resources and require more complex algorithms to provide interactive assistance. It must be noted that the practical implementation of such systems might face design challenges and be constrained by technological infrastructure.

In Arendtian terms, this work involves making visible the invisible structures that modern computing thrives upon. Beyond its practicality, transforming the way we interact with computer code influences our understanding and experience of the digital world and our place in it. Given the significant role of computing in all modern human affairs, this shift could have extensive implications for human destiny.

*** Code
A simple Clojure example using pattern matching, without live feedback mechanism, could be:

```clojure
#+begin_src clojure
(defn match-pattern [x]
  (cond
   (= x 1) "one"
   (= x 2) "two"
   :else "unknown"))
(match-pattern 2) ; Returns "two"
(match-pattern 3) ; Returns "unknown"
#+end_src
```
Including live feedback to such pattern matching could potentially allow more interactive and guided coding.

*** Questions

1. How are the 'typed holes' related to traditional type-checking systems and how do they enhance interactive programming?

2. What practical limitations could possibly arise while implementing live feedback in pattern-matching systems?

3. What are the larger implications of integrating interactive programming processes to our understanding of code and the digital world?
