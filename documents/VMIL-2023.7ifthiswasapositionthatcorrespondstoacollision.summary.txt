This section discusses the performance of the fibonacci micro-benchmark when using different execution models. The models discussed are 'CPS Object', 'Threaded', 'ByteCode', 'CPS Send', 'Threaded Send', and 'FullDispatch'. The results of the benchmark are compared to Pharo JIT, Pharo Stack, Native, Object, and CPS Object. The results show that CPS Object is only 20% slower than Native, and 10-40% faster than the Pharo JIT’ed code. Threaded is 2-3 times slower than the Pharo JIT’ed code. ByteCode is 1/2 the size of the threaded version but almost 4 times slower. CPS Send and Threaded Send are the same as the ones above, except messages to fibonacci are sent using full dynamic dispatch. FullDispatch is a threaded version that does all the sends explicitly, as well as the non-local-return from the block. The section also discusses related work and future work.
