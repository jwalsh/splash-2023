Title-Abstract. Section intro
-scalar Semi-rings. The support for semi-ring extensions in SDQL is beyond scalar types.
As an example, SDQL supports the (semi-)ring of the covariance matrix [Nikolic and Olteanu
2018]. For each 𝑛 ∈ Z, the domain D of this semi-ring is a triple < R, R𝑛, R𝑛×𝑛 >. The additive
and multiplicative identities are defined as 0D ≜< 0, 0𝑛, 0𝑛×𝑛 > and 1D ≜< 1, 0𝑛, 0𝑛×𝑛 >. For each
� ≜< 𝑠𝑎, 𝑣𝑎, 𝑚𝑎 > and 𝑏 ≜< 𝑠𝑏, 𝑣𝑏, 𝑚𝑏 >, the addition and multiplication are defined as:

𝑎 +D � ≜ < 𝑠𝑎 + 𝑠𝑏, 𝑣𝑎 + 𝑣𝑏, 𝑚𝑎 + 𝑚𝑏 >
𝑎 ×D 𝑏 ≜ < 𝑠𝑎 ∗ 𝑠𝑏, 𝑠𝑎 ∗ 𝑣𝑏 + 𝑣𝑎 ∗ 𝑠𝑏, 𝑠𝑏 ∗ 𝑚𝑎 + 𝑠𝑎 ∗ 𝑚𝑏 + 𝑣𝑎 ∗ 𝑣𝑏 + 𝑣𝑏 ∗ 𝑣𝑎 >

We use this semi-ring to compute covariance matrix as aggregates over relations (cf. Section 9.4).

8.4 Language Extensions
In this section, we define possible language extensions over SDQL. Apart from an additional
expressive power, each extension enables further optimizations, which are demonstrated in Figure 14.
We use SDQL[X] to denote SDQL extended with X.
SDQL[ring]: SDQL + Ring Dictionaries. We have consistently talked about semi-ring structures,
and how semi-ring dictionaries
