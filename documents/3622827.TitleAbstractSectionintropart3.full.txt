 of their method is generally applicable, it is not applied to other SMR
schemes and data structures.

Meyer and Wolﬀ [2019a,b]; Wolﬀ21] developed an automaticability checker for
concurrent data structures with SMR schemes veri�cationitional as parametric
over the speciﬁcations for each SMR scheme. Their method is easy to integrate as theirﬁer
automatically checks whether a given linearizable concurrent data structure without reclamation
can be adapted to that with reclamation. However, their not generally applicable because
it relies on a linearizability checker that does not scale to sophisticated non-blocking data structures
such as Harris’s list [Harris 2001].

1.3 Contributions: Modular Verification of Memory Reclamation

We propose modular speciﬁcations of hazard pointers and RCU, formally verify realistic implemen-
tations of them, and demonstrate that the speciﬁcations indeed facilitate modular veriﬁcation
