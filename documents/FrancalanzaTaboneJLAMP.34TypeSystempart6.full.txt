3.4. Type System
 Rules [tTuple], [tEList] and
[tList] check the types of tuples, empty lists and respectively. Rule [tArithmetic] en-
sures that numbers are used when doing. The remaining rules, [tBoolean[tNot] and [tCompar are analogous.

Pattern Typing. In the term typing rules [tBranch] andCase], new variables are introduced as
a result of pattern matching. These need to be their respective type for typechecking
purposes is obtained via ⊢p
pat T : Γ ▷ defined in Figure 6, which states
that all variables in a pattern p are collected (with their type) in Γ. Basic values are checked in
[tpBasic], and new variables are introduced in [tpVariable]. The latter also ensures that the pid of
the dual process remains unchanged (i.e., x (cid:44) w), which allows to statically locate the destination
pid messages. Each element in a tuple is checked individually for either values or variables
([tpTuple]). Lists are checked using [tpEList] and [tpList]. Multiple variable environments Γ
and Γ′ are joined together as Γ, Γ′ (their domains must be distinct).
