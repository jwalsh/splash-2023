This section describes the notion of an on-demand call graph, which is a subgraph of the whole-program call graph that contains all the edges necessary to answer the queries issued by a client analysis. It is characterized by the notion of (C, F)-soundness, where C is a set of callee queries and F is a set of caller queries. To construct an on-demand call graph, the algorithm starts from an empty call graph and gradually adds edges based on answers to the callee and caller queries. This is done by using two data flow analyses, a forward analysis F and a backward analysis B, which are both on-demand analyses and return an overapproximation of the set of subtraces relevant to a given call graph query. The algorithm also defines the notions of backward and forward compatibility of a given trace with a partial call graph, which are used to restrict the traces that need to be overapproximated by the data flow analyses. Finally, the section defines the soundness requirements on F and B, and states that if all the assumptions outlined in the section are satisfied, the call graph construction is sound.
