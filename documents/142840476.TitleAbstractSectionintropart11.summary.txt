This section discusses the process of assigning an affine equation of the form x = b + (sum of z in V * az) to an octagon constraint r with coefficients b(cid:96) and (cid:96) in LX. It is assumed that x does not occur in the right-hand side. Depending on (cid:96), the objective functions are x, x + y, -x + y, x - y, -x - y. The best upper bound b(cid:48) (cid:96) for the octagon combination (cid:96) with x occurring in (cid:96) is obtained by a linear program of the form (13). The section also discusses the NP-hardness of solving integer linear programs with octagon constraints.
