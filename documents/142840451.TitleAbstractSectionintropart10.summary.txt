This section provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of Merlin, a prototype for on-demand call graph construction in higher-order languages. The experiments were conducted on an AWS EC2 instance with Intel Xeon Platinum 8124M CPU with 16 cores and 32 GiB memory. The results of running Merlin on the synthetic benchmarks showed that the wall clock time grows super-linearly with the number of resolved queries, and the number of queries that need to be resolved increases with the number of initial queries. Whole-program analysis results often require less wall clock time to resolve than smaller initial sets of queries due to the use of parallelism in the prototype. Memory consumption remains relatively constant, indicating a significant fixed memory cost in the implementation. The section also discusses the threats to validity and limitations of the prototype, and provides an overview of related work.
