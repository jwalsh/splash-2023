This section discusses the role of safety norms in the development and verification of safety-critical systems. It explains how safety norms define the minimal requirements for developers of safety-critical systems to make sure that unreasonable safety risks are avoided. It also discusses the DO-178C and ISO 26262 standards, which provide guidance on the use of formal methods to complement or replace dynamic testing. It also mentions the EN 50128 and IEC 62304 standards, which lack an explicit reference to Abstract Interpretation. The section concludes by noting that the availability of mature development and verification techniques should be taken into account when developing industrial systems, and that an exchange between software and safety communities is essential.
