Recent advances in concurrent enabled the formal veriﬁcation of increasingly sophisticated
ﬁne-grained (i.e., lock-free) concurrent programs. For such programs, the golden standard of correctness is
linearizability, which expresses that concurrent executions always behave as some valid sequence of sequential
executions. Compositional approaches to linearizability (such as contextual reﬁnement and logical atomicity)
make it possible to prove linearizability of whole programs or compound data structures (e.g., a ticket lock)
using proofs of linearizability of
