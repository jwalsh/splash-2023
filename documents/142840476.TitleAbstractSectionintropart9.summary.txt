This section discusses octagons revisited, elegant proofs and simplified algorithms. Algorithm 2 is presented for a collection S(cid:48) = (cid:104)sp(cid:105)p∈[X ]2,(p(cid:54)⊆V ∨|p|(cid:54)=2) ∪ S1. It is shown that re-establishing normalization (and thus closure) after adding octagon constraints for m variables is in O(m · n2). It is also discussed how to compute the values of a normalized value r over the set X of program variables from some 2-decomposable relational domain after an assignment a of the form x ← e where e is an expression over some subset V ⊆ X. It is concluded that a normalization of the relation (cid:74)a(cid:75)(cid:93)r can be computed in linear time. Finally, it is discussed how to implement best abstract transformers for assignments for the octagon domain (over rationals as well as over integers) by adding octagon constraints or expressing them by means of optimization problems. It is also noted that over the rationals, the set of octagon constraints to be satisﬁed in optimization problems can be restricted to constraints where each occurring variable z ∈ V occurs with the same sign as the coeﬃcient az of z in the objective function.
