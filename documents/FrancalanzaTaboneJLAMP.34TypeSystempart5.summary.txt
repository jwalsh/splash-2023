This section describes the type system for structures such as lists or basic values. It is defined by the simplepat rule, which limits the branches of a receive construct to accept any value. The tChoice rule requires an internal choice session type and checks the label tagging the message payloads and the pid of the addressee of the send statement. The tKnownCall rule verifies that the expected initial session type is equivalent to the function's known session type. The tLet rule ensures that the parameters have the correct types and the tCase rule checks that each case has to match the corresponding type and session type. The tExpression rule checks all expressions using expression typing. The expressions typing rules are adapted from [13] and include the tBasic and tVariable rules.
