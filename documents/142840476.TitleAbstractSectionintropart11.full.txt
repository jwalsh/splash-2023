Title-Abstract. Section intro
 the left-hand side of the constraint for z(cid:48) is decreased with y(cid:96)(cid:48)
r(cid:48), while at the
same time yq is increased with y(cid:96)r. If it is contained both in (cid:96)r and (cid:96)(cid:48)
r(cid:48), then y(cid:96)r
in the left-hand side of the constraint for z(cid:48) is decreased with y(cid:96)(cid:48)
r(cid:48), y(cid:96)(cid:48)
r(cid:48) is set to
0, yq is increased with 2 · y(cid:96)(cid:48)
r(cid:48).

Thus, in all cases, the equation is satisﬁed for the y(cid:48)
p.
We conclude that the combination (cid:96)r can equivalently be removed by means

of the octagon combination q not involving the variable z.

Therefore, now assume that y(cid:96)(cid:48)

r(cid:48) > y(cid:96)r where, w.l.o.g., the maximal value of
the non-zero y(cid:96)j equals y(cid:96)r. If (cid:96)r + (cid:96)(cid:48)
r(cid: = 0 (otherwise the
r(cid:48) − y(cid:96)r, and y(cid:48)
gain were not minimal). Therefore, we set y(cid:48)
(cid:96) = (cid:pwise to obtain a feasible solution where the minimal gain is attained. At
the same time, the number of octagon combinations (cid:96) with y(cid:48)
(cid:96) > 0 where z
occurs positively has decreased. Therefore, assume that (cid:96)r + (cid:96)(cid:48)
r(cid:48) is diﬀerent from
0. Then there is a coeﬃcient c ∈ {1, 2} and an octagon constraint q such that

r(cid:48) = 0, then b(cid:96)r + b(cid:96)(cid:48)
= 0, y(cid:48)
r(cid:48) = yid:96)(cid:48)

r(cid:48) and c · bq ≤ b(cid:96)r + b(cid:96)(cid:48)

r(cid:48). Then we set



y(cid:48)
(cid:96) =

0 if (cid:96) = (cid:96)r
r(cid:48) − y(cid:96)r if (cid:96) = (cid:96)(cid:48)
y(cid:96)(cid:48)
r(cid:48)
yq + c · y(cid:96)r if (cid:96) = q
y(cid:96) otherwise

Again, we obtain a feasible solution where the gain has not increased, but the
number of octagon combinations (cid:96) with y(cid:48)
(cid:96) > 0 where z occurs positively has
decreased. Altogether, we conclude that, without increasing the gain, the feasible
solution y(cid:96) can be adjusted such that y(cid:96) = 0 for (cid:96) whenever (cid:96) contains negative
occurrences of variables in V.
As a result, we obtain dual of the simpliﬁed LP problem

subject to yz1 +(cid:80)

z1∈V yz1 · bz1 +(cid:80)

z2∈V \{z1} yz1+z2 · bz1+z2

(z1 ∈ V )
(z1, z2 ∈ z1 (cid:54)= z2)

Example 7. Assume that of program variables consists of x, z1, z z3,
that our goal is to maximize the linear objective function 2z1 + 3z2 + z3 subject
to the octagon constraints

z1 + z2 ≤ 10

z1 + z3 ≤ 1

z2 + z3 ≤ 1

The dual linear program then is given by
y1 · 10 + y2 + y3

minimize
subject to y1 + y2 = 2 y1 + y3 = 3 y2 + y3 = 1
1, y2, y3 ≥ 0

In this case, there is just one possible solution for the yi, namely,

y1 = 2.5 y2 = 0.5 y3 = 0.5

— implying optimal value is given by 25 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 26.

(cid:117)(cid:116)
For an optimization problem with integer octagon constraints, we may, in
principle, proceed as for rationals. Solving integer linear programs with octagon
constraints precisely, however, is NP-hard. This can be seen, e.g., by reduction
from the NP-complete maximum clique problem, i.e., the problem of deciding
whether the maximal size of a clique in an undirected graph exceeds some bound.
Let G = (V, E) denote a ﬁnirected graph, and choose V as the set of
variables. Then we construct optimization problem

maximize (cid:80)

x∈V x
subject to x + y ≤ 1
−x ≤ 0
x ≤ 1

(x ∈ V )
(x ∈ V )

The constraints are all integer octagon constraints, while the solution to the
optimization problem equals the maximal size of a clique. Since the construction
of the integer optimization problem from the instance of the clique problem can
be done in polynomial time, it follows that to decide whether the optimal value
for an integer linear program with octagon constraints exceeds some value, is
NP-hard.

8 Abstract Assignments for Octagons

Assume that we are given an aﬃne assignment of the form

x ← b +(cid:80)

z∈V az · z

and that the octagon before the assignment is a closed octagon r with coeﬃcients
b(cid:96), (cid:96) ∈ LX. W.l.o., assume that x does not occur in the right-hand side, i.e.,
x (cid:54)∈ V the rationals, the best upper bound b(cid:48)
(cid:96) for the octagon combination (cid:96)
with x occurring in (cid:96) is obtained by a linear program of the form (13). Depending
on (cid:96), the objective functions are
