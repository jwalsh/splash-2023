This section provides a proof of the proposition that linear combinations z and z + y for z, y ∈ V and z = y can be attained by a feasible solution y(cid:96), (cid:96) ∈ L, where y(cid:96) = 0 for all octagon combinations (cid:96) which contain negations. The proof is obtained by means of the dual program, which has a feasible solution y(cid:96), (cid:96) ∈ LV, where y(cid:96) · b(cid:96) = b. The proof proceeds by induction on the number of octagon combinations (cid:96) with negative occurrences of variables from V. The linear constraint in (13) for z is considered, and a correction factor c is introduced. The octagon combination with c·q = (cid:96)r +(cid:96)(cid:48) is defined, and a feasible solution y(cid:48) (cid:96) is constructed, where the same gain b is attained. Finally, it is shown that the y(cid:48) (cid:96) form a feasible solution of the constraints in (13).
