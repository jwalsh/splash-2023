This section discusses Weakly Relational Domains, which are domains that track relationships between subclusters of variables instead of all variables. Schwarz et al. introduced the notion of 2-decomposable relational domains, which are domains where the full value can be recovered from the restriction to all clusters of variables of size at most 2, and all finite upper bounds can be recovered by computing within these clusters only. This is done by computing the meet of relations Y, Y âˆˆ S, where S is a subset of 2X of clusters of variables, and r is a relation in R.
