is returned along the outermost modulo from the main expression as modular
specifications. This is formalized in the following inference rule.

The following theorem states that the evaluation of a translated expression
keeps all the possible values of the evaluation of the original expression. More-
over, the set of potential error alarms returned by the translation contains at
least all the potential error alarms of the evaluation of the original expression.
This is a stronger statement than the one needed to rewrite expressions, that
corresponds to the corollary below, because the error alarms that may be yield
by the evaluation of the abstract expression are discarded.
