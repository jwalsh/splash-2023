This section discusses the use of abduction and transformer hints in Diaframe 2.0, a proof automation system for separation logic. Abduction hints directly represent hints of Category 2, while Category 1 is encoded by performing a technical trick relying on the fact that  ′ ⊢  implies True ∗ ′ ⊢ . To account for the case where a priority of rules is desired, two syntactical markers 0 ≜ True and 1 ≜ True are defined. Abduction hints serve two purposes: they both implement the proof search strategy and prove it sound. 

Near-applicability is also discussed, where Diaframe 2.0 can apply abduction hints when the logical state or current goal nearly matches a rule. An example is given of the rule rec-apply from §3.3 to apply Löb induction hypotheses, which is decomposed into separate hints for each task. 

Transformer hints are also discussed, which capture rules in Category 3. Examples are given of the introduction rules for the later (⊲) and persistence ((cid:31)) modalities. Transformer hints come in two flavors—hypothesis and context transformer hints. If we are proving a goal of shape Δ ⊢ T, the proof search strategy takes the following steps: (1) Find  ∈ Δ and T ′ such that , T →∼hyp [T ′]. Continue with goal Δ′ ⊢ T ′, where Δ′ is the context Δ in which  is removed. (2) Otherwise, ﬁnd  such that Δ, T →∼ctx []. Continue with goal Δ ⊢ . The transformer hints for the later modality ﬁrst ‘revert’ and strip the later oﬀ of all hypotheses with a later, and only then introduce the later modality.
