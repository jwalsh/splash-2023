Title-Abstract. Section intro
 a specific analysis state
is reached. We divided these meta-predicates into three cate-
gories: store-related, worklist-related, and lattice-based pred-
icates.

We implemented our debugger in a framework called MAF,
and showed the applicability of our debugger on one syn-
thetic and four real-world bugs lifted from the repository of
the framework. In this case study, the debugger is highly ef-
fective for most bugs that relate to changes of store addresses
and their contents, but less so for bugs that prevent analysis
progress, or dependency-triggering related bugs. However,
we argued that our approach is sufficienlty flexible to sup-
port these classes of bugs in future work through additional
meta-predicates.
