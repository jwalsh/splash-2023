 again, may result in a signiﬁcant speedup when it
comes to practical implementations.

In future work, we would like to provide a new implementation of Octagon
domains based on our algorithms and evaluate its practical performance on re-
alistic examples. Combining our algorithms with orthogonal techniques such as
online decomposition [28] in particular seems like a promising line of inquiry.
We also would like to explore in greater detail the potential of further, perhaps
non-numerical 2-decomposable domains.

A 2-Projectivity for Extensions of Octagons

Here, we investigate extensions to the Octagon domain and the domain of dif-
ference bounds, respectively, that have been proposed in the literature, and in-
vestigate whether they are 2-decomposable and 2-projective.

Example 8. Consider the domain of di�-bound matrices enhanced with
disequalities [24] where X = {a, b, c}. This domain is 2-decomposable. Now, for
2-projectivity, let, e.g.,

r{a,b} = (a − b ≤ −1 ∧ b (cid:54)= 98 ∧ b (cid:54)= 97)
r{a,c} = (c ≤ 99)
r{b,c} = (b − c ≤ −1)

and all other rp = (cid:62). We remark that, by abuse of notation, we write b (cid:54)= 98
instead of introducing a dedicated variable c98 and constraints b (cid:54)= c98 ∧ c98 ≤
98∧0−c98 ≤ −98, and analogously for b (cid:54)= 97. Now, consider (9) with Y = {a, c},
z = b, r(cid:48) = {c ≤ 99} Then,

(r{b} ∧ r{b,a} ∧ r{b,c} ∧ r(cid:48))(cid:12)(cid:12)Y
= (r{b} ∧ r{b,a} ∧ r{b,c} ∧ r(cid:48))(cid:12)(cid:12){a,c}
= (c ≤ 99) ∧ (r{b} ∧ r{b})(cid:12)(cid:12)∅ ∧ (r{a,b} ∧ r{a,b})(cid:12)(cid:12){a} ∧ (r{b,c} ∧ r{b,c})(cid:12)(cid:12){c}
∧(r{a,b} ∧ r{b,c})(cid:12)(cid:12){a,c} ∧ (r{b} ∧ r{b,a})(cid:12)(cid:12){a} ∧ (r{b} ∧ r{b,c})(cid:12)(cid:12){c}
= r(cid:48) ∧(cid:86)k

= (c ∧ a − c ≤ −2 ∧ c ≤ 95)
(cid:54)= (c ≤ 99 ∧ a − c ≤ −2 ∧ c ≤ 97)
= (c ≤ 99) ∧ (cid:62) ∧ (cid:62) ∧ (cid) ∧ (a − c ≤ −2) ∧ (cid:62) ∧ (c62)

i,j=1 (r{b,yi} ∧ r{b,yj})(cid:12)(cid:12)Y{yi,yj}

and the domain thus is not 2-projective.

Example 9. domain of octagons enhanced with additional con-
str the absolute values of variables [5], i.e., with additional constraints
of the form ±|x| ± |y| ≤ c and ±|x| ± y ≤ c. This domain is 2-decomposable.

Now, for 2-projectivity, let, e.g.,

r{a,d} = a − |d| ≤ 2
r{b,c} = b + c ≤ 5
r{b,d} = b − d ≤ 5
r{c,d} = −c + d ≤ 2 ∧ −|d| ≤ 0

with all other rp = (cid:62) for p ∈ [X ]2. Now, consider (9) with Y = {a, b, c}, z = d,
