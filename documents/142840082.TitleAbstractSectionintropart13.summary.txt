This section provides an overview of symbolic transformation of expressions in modular arithmetic. It explains how the reduce parametric operator can be used to simplify the resulting abstract expression. It also provides two inference rules depending on the sign of the denominator and the elements of the modulo interval. The section also explains how to propagate modular computations across divisions, and the conditions that must be met for this to be done precisely.
