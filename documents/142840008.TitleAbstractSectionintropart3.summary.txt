This section discusses the use of the Abstract Interpretation (aiT) tool in industry and academia. It explains how aiT has been integrated with several schedulability analysis tools and how a Qualification Support Kit (QSK) has been developed to demonstrate the tool's suitability for safety-critical software. It also describes how aiT has been used to address the problem of different hardware configurations in WCET customers, and how it has been used to develop Astrée and CompCert, two AbsInt products. The section then discusses the application of aiT to non-timing-predictable architectures, and the spin-off of a worst-case stack usage analysis tool, StackAnalyzer. Finally, it explains the purpose of the Astrée analyzer, which is to detect source-level runtime errors due to undefined or unspecified behaviors of C programs.
