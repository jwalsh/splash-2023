This section discusses various approaches to the verification of safe memory reclamation in concurrent separation logic. Tofan et al. [2011] verified linearizability and lock freedom of Treiber’s stack and Michael-Scott queue with hazard pointers in temporal logic. Fu et al. [2010] verified the safety of Treiber’s stack with hazard pointers in temporal separation logic supporting rely-guarantee reasoning. Gotsman et al. [2013] presented a principled approach for applying temporal separation logic to SMR schemes, but it is not compositional because it exposes the implementation details of SMR schemes. Tassarotti et al. [2015] accounted for RCU’s synchronization purely in terms of ownership transfer in a separation logic for relaxed memory, but it is not compositional. Meyer and Wolff [2019a,b]; Wolff [2021] designed an automated linearizability checker, but it is not generally applicable in practice due to the complexity of the check and unsoundness of the backend verifier.
