This section discusses the Cascade framework, which consists of a compiler written in Rascal and Delta, a runtime written in C#. It explains how the main components process and transform events, and how the scheduler determines the order in which events are scheduled, generated and migrated. It also introduces LiveSML, an event-based language design, and explains how it works by providing a schematic of dependencies between creation events, deletion events and run-time triggers.
