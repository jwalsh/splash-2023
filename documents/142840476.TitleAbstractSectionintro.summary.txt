This section discusses the Octagon domain, which is a mild extension of the non-relational domain of Intervals for program variables. It provides efficient procedures for the Octagon domain with simple proofs, based on two generic properties of relational domains: 2-decomposability and 2-projectivity. These properties are sufficient for an abstract version of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to provide normal forms. The section also provides an algorithm for incremental normalization, and improved abstract transformers for affine assignments based on linear programming.
