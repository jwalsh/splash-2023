This section discusses 2-decomposable domains, which are domains that can be represented by the meet of its restrictions to 2-clusters. Examples of 2-decomposable domains include the Octagon domain over rationals or integers, aﬃne equalities, and aﬃne inequalities. An algorithm to compute the 2-normal representation of a value from a 2-decomposable domain is discussed, as well as a Kleene ﬁxpoint iteration for computing greatest solutions of constraint systems. It is then shown that rational octagons, integer octagons, 2-variable rational aﬃne inequalities, and 2-variable rational aﬃne equalities are all 2-projective. The section then provides an example of an integer octagon and how to compute its closure.
