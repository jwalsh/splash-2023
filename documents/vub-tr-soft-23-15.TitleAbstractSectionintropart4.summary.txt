This section introduces the design of an analysis-tailored debugger. It discusses its visualisation, stepping and breakpoint functionality, and meta-predicates for cross-level conditional breakpoints. The visualisation consists of four parts: the code being analyzed, a graph of components and their dependencies, an overview of the global store, and a visualisation of the worklist algorithm. The debugger provides two types of stepping and breakpoints are represented as expressions in the analyzed program. Meta-predicates are split into three categories: store-based, worklist-based and lattice-based. Store-based meta-predicates express conditions on the state of the global store, worklist-based meta-predicates express conditions on the state of the worklist, and lattice-based meta-predicates express conditions on the lattice values of the analyzed program.
