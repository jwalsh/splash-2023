This section discusses the verification of hazard pointers in concurrent separation logic. Hazard pointers is a mechanism to distribute and recollect the partial ownerships of pointers in the form of managed pointer assertion and the protected pointer assertions for each thread. A fractional points-to assertion is used to model the per-thread ownership of a pointer, which is split into a Managed assertion and Protected assertions for each thread. The rules-Access, Protected-Access Protected-Managed-Agree are derived from the analogous rules for fractional points-to. The life cycle of a points-to assertion is then discussed, which is transferred and shared among the memory allocator, the data structure, the protecting threads, reclaiming thread. Finally, the synchronization between protection and reclamation is discussed, which is illustrated in Fig. 8.
