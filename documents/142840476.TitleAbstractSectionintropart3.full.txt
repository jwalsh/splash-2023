R ⊆ R. The most prominent example of a 2-decomposable domain is the Octagon
domain [20] – either over rationals or integers, while aﬃne equalities or aﬃne
(cid:68)
inequalities are examples of domains that are not 2-decomposable.
Each value r from a 2-decomposable relational domain R can be represented
r|p

[X ]2}. Then r|p (cid:118) sp always holds, while equality need not hold. In the Octagon
domain over the rationals or the integers, the 2-normal representation of an
octagon value corresponds to its strong closure and tight closure, respectively,
as described in [1, 20]. Here, we do not distinguish between diﬀerent types of
closure for rational and integer octagons. Instead, we call a non-⊥ octagon O
over a numerical set of values I ∈ {Q, Z} closed if for each octagon combination
(cid:96), the upper bound b(cid:96) equals the minimal value b ∈ I such that (cid:96) ≤ b is implied
by O, or ∞ if no such bound exists.

While for rational octagons, closure in cubic time was already proposed by
Miné [20], it is much more recent that a corresponding algorithm was provided
for integer octagons [1, 2]. Here, we re-consider these results. By referring to
2-decomposable domains instead of to octagons, we succeed in providing a con-
ceptually simple normalization algorithm with a simple correctness proof, from
which cubic closure algorithms for the Octagon domains can be derived.

Subsequently, we assume that R is an arbitrary 2-decomposable domain over
Rp}. Then, we consider the following constraint system in the unknowns rp, p ∈
[X ]2, over R,

r{x,y} (cid:118) s{x,y} (cid:117)(cid:0)r{x,z} (cid:117) r{z,y}(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12){x,y}

for x, y, z ∈ X. All right-hand sides of the constraint system (8) are monotonic.

Proposition 1. The collection (cid:104)r|p(cid:105)p∈[X ]2 is a solution of constraint system (8).
Proof. Let x, y, z ∈ X. Then

r|{x,y} = r|{x,y} (cid:117) r|{x,y} (cid:118) s{x,y} (cid:117) r|{x,y} (cid:118) s{x,y} (cid:117)(cid:16)

r|{x,z} (cid:117) r|{z,y}

(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12){x,y} (cid:117)(cid:116)

From Proposition 1, we conclude that the greatest solution of (8) – if it exists –
is an overapproximation of the normal representation of r. In general, the Kleene
ﬁxpoint iteration for computing greatest solutions of constraint systems (8) may
not terminate. Let us call a 2-decomposable relational domain R 2-projective
when from each abstract relation r, each single variable can be eliminated by
using projections onto clusters from [X ]2 only, i.e., when for every Y ⊆ X,
z ∈ X \ Y, yj ∈ Y ∪ {z}, r(cid:48) ∈ RY, and r{z,yj} ∈ R{z,yj},

(cid:0)r{z,y1} (cid:117)... (cid:117) r{z,yk} (cid:117) r(cid:48)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)Y = r(cid:48) (cid:117)(cid:100)k

Proposition 2. The following 2-decomposable domains are 2-projective:

1. rational octagons;
2. integer octagons;
3. 2-variable rational aﬃne inequalities;
4. 2-variable rational aﬃne equalities.

Proof. Let us consider the claims (1) and (2) for octagons. Intuitively, their cor-
rectness follows from the correctness of Fourier-Motzkin elimination of a single
variable z from a system of inequalities. In general, this holds only for ratio-
nal inequalities as considered for claim (1). However, it also holds for systems
of integer inequalities – given that all coeﬃcients are integer and all non-zero
coeﬃcients of z are either 1 or −1.
x∈X ax · x an octagon combination if at
most two of the coeﬃcients ax are non-zero and these are then from {−1, 1}. For
a subset Y of variables, let LY denote the set of all octagon combinations with
variables from Y. An integer octagon constraint is of the form (cid:96) ≤ b where (cid:96) is
a linear octagon combination and the bound b is integer or ∞.

Let us call a linear combination (cid:80)

Subsequently, we represent an abstract octagon relation over Y by a closed

conjunction

(cid:86)

(10)
of octagon constraints with variables from Y if the octagon is satisﬁable, or ⊥
if it is not. Here, the conjunction (10) is satisﬁable and closed iﬀ

(cid:96)∈LY

(cid:96) ≤ b(cid:96)

0 ≤ b(cid:96) + b−(cid:96)
b(cid:96) ≤ (b(cid:96)1 + b(cid:96)2 )/c

if (cid:96) ∈ LY
if (cid:96)1 (cid:54)= (cid:96)2 and c · (cid:96) = (cid:96)1 + (cid:96)2

holds for some c ∈ {1, 2}. Here, factor 2 occurs if one variable x occurs both
in (cid:96)1 and (cid:96)2 with the same sign, while another variable y occurs with diﬀerent
signs, i.e.,

c · (cid:96) = (x + y) + (x − y) = 2 · x

In case of octagons over rationals, the operator “/” denotes division, whereas
in case of octagons over integers, it denotes integer division, i.e., may include
rounding downwards. By deﬁnition, the closed representation of an abstract
octagon relation is also 2-normal.

For computing the closure for an arbitrary conjunction r of octagon con-
straints with one or two variables only, we may ﬁrst determine the least given
upper bound b(cid:96) for each occurring octagon linear combination (cid:96). As a result, we
obtain at most 8 octagon constraints for which satiﬁability (over rationals or in-
tegers) can be decided in constant time. Provided the conjunction is satisﬁable,
all implied tighter upper bounds (over rationals or integers) can be inferred.
Example 2. Consider the integer octagon given by conjunction of the constraints

x + y ≤ −2

x − y ≤ 5

− x + y ≤ 0

By adding up constraints with positive and negative occurrences of the same
variable, we derive that

y ≤ −1

x ≤ 1

must also hold, while no further bounds can be inferred. If the conjunction of
octagon constraints additionally has the inequality

−x − y ≤ 0

then, by adding this to the ﬁrst inequality, we derive

0 ≤ −2

– which is false – implying that the octagon equals ⊥.
(cid:117)(cid:116)
Assume that each non-⊥ value r{yj,z}, yj ∈ Y ∪ {z}, is represented as a closed
conjunction of octagon constraints with variables from {yj, z}. Assume likewise,
that r(cid:48) (cid:54)= ⊥ is represented by a conjunction of octagon constraints with variables
from Y
