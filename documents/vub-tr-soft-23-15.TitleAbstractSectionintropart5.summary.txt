This section provides an overview of the meta-predicates available in the debugger. These predicates are divided into two categories: store predicates and lattice predicates. The store predicates allow for expressing conditional breakpoints that break on the absence of a particular store address. The second predicate, called store:changed?, returns true whenever a particular address in the store has changed since the last break. The lattice predicates provide an interface to the abstract lattice operations and are divided into two sub-categories: type-checking predicates, and reified abstract operations. Finally, the worklist predicates provide information about the current state of the worklist. Examples of conditional breakpoints are provided to illustrate the synergy between the different categories of meta-predicates.
