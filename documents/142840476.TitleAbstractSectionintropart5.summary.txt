This section provides a proof of Proposition 3, which states that for a given set of variables X = {x1... xn}, and let Xr = {x1,..., xr}, and ¯Xr = X \ Xr for r = 0,..., n, and a given sp ∈ Rp, (p ∈ [X ]2), the sequence s(r){x,y} = s(r−1){x,y} (cid:117)(cid:16) s(r−1){x,xr} (cid:117) s(r−1){xr,y} (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12){x,y} for r > 0 holds. The proof is done by induction, and the proposition holds for r = 0 by definition. For r > 0, the first claim is calculated and the second claim is shown by considering the case xr (cid:54)∈ {x, y}.
