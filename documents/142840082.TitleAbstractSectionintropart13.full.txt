operator is used to suppress the modulo computations in both translations of

possible loss of information. The resulting abstract expression can be potentially
simplified by the means of the reduce parametric operator. Such computation

two inference rules are provided, depending on the sign of both the denominator
and the elements of the modulo interval. In such a case, the abstract expression

translation of its operands, thanks to the reduce primitive. This expression can
be evaluated in modular arithmetic: the resulting modular ring is obtained by
dividing by the constant both bounds of the modular ring of the numerator (or

Division. Propagating modular computations across divisions is quite tricky.
Indeed, it can be done precisely only when the following conditions are met.
First, the numerator has to be positive. We then consider the modulo interval
of the numerator. The denominator has to be a nonzero constant that divides
both bounds of this interval (or the bounds of the interval that contains the
opposite values when the constant is negative). In addition, this interval must

not include both negative (i.e.,<0) and positive (i.e.,>0) values. That is why
is obtained by reducing the result of the application of the⧄ operator to the
its opposite when the constant is negative). Because the constant is not0, the
computation does not yield additional error alarms. In all other cases, thermMod

prove that the value of the denominator cannot be0.
