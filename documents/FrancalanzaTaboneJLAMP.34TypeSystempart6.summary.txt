This section discusses the type system used in the term typing rules. Rules [tTuple], [tEList] and [tList] check the types of tuples, empty lists and lists respectively. Rule [tArithmetic] ensures that numbers are used when doing arithmetic operations. The remaining rules [tBoolean], [tNot] and [tCompar] are analogous. Pattern Typing is used to introduce new variables as a result of pattern matching. The type of these variables is obtained via the rule [tBranch] and [tCase]. Basic values are checked in [tpBasic], and new variables are introduced in [tpVariable]. The pid of the dual process remains unchanged. Each element in a tuple is checked individually for either values or variables ([tpTuple]). Lists are checked using [tpEList] and [tpList]. Multiple variable environments Γ and Γ′ are joined together as Γ, Γ′.
