This section describes language extensions for SDQL (Scalar Data Query Language). It explains how SDQL supports semi-ring extensions, such as the covariance matrix, and how these extensions enable further optimizations. The semi-ring structure is defined as a triple < R, R𝑛, R𝑛×𝑛 >, with the additive and multiplicative identities being 0D ≜< 0, 0𝑛, 0𝑛×𝑛 > and 1D ≜< 1, 0𝑛, 0𝑛×𝑛 > respectively. The addition and multiplication are defined as 𝑎 +D � ≜ < 𝑠𝑎 + 𝑠𝑏, 𝑣𝑎 + 𝑣𝑏, 𝑚𝑎 + 𝑚𝑏 > and 𝑎 ×D 𝑏 ≜ < 𝑠𝑎 ∗ 𝑠𝑏, 𝑠𝑎 ∗ 𝑣𝑏 + 𝑣𝑎 ∗ 𝑠𝑏, 𝑠𝑏 ∗ 𝑚𝑎 + 𝑠𝑎 ∗ 𝑚𝑏 + 𝑣𝑎 ∗ 𝑣𝑏 + 𝑣𝑏 ∗ 𝑣𝑎 >. This semi-ring is used to compute covariance matrix as aggregates over relations. The section also introduces SDQL[ring], which is SDQL extended with Ring Dictionaries, and explains how this extension enables further optimizations.
