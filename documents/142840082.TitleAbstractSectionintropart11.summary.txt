This section provides an overview of the symbolic transformation of expressions in modular arithmetic. It outlines the inference rules for translating expressions such as intervals, unary minus, convex join, and addition. The translation of each expression yields an abstract expression, a modulo specification, and a set of potential errors. The reduce operator is applied to potentially simplify the resulting abstract expression, and the operatorrmMod is used to remove modulo operators in both translations of the arguments. The result can be interpreted inâ„¤, or in a modular ring. No additional potential errors are collected.
