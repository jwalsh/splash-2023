This section provides a formal proof of the soundness of the on-demand call graph construction algorithm. It introduces a formal, semantic model of programs, call graphs and queries, and defines the desired property of on-demand call graph soundness. It then introduces the algorithm in the form of a transition system defined by a set of inference rules, and states the soundness result that call graphs generated by the rules for a given input program and set of input queries are on-demand sound. The full proof has been formalized using Isabelle/HOL and is available online.
