3.1 Relational Algebra
Relational algebra [Codd 1970] is the foundation of many query languages used in database systems, including SQL general, a relation 𝑅(𝑎..., 𝑎𝑛) ( semantics) is
represented as a dictionary of type { <𝑎1: �1, 𝑎𝑛: 𝐴� -> bool } in SDQL. Figure 4 shows
the translation rules relational algebra operators. SDQL can also express different variants
of joins/semi-joins explanation relational variousoperators can be found supplementary materials.
Example 3. Consider the following data for the Genes input, which is a flat relation providing
positional information of genes on the genome:

Genes

name

desc

contig

start

end

gidNOT
BRCATP53

notch receptor 2

DNA repair associate

t protein p53

1
17119
295
7565097

120100779 ENSG00000134250
43170245
ENSG00000012048
ENSG00000141510
7590856

This relation is represented as follows in SDQL:

nameCH2",desc=" receptor 2", contig,119911553, end=120100779, gid="ENSG34250">,<B1",desc="DNA repair associate", contig=17, start44295, end=43170245,="ENSG00000012048">,
<name="TP53="tumor53ig=17=97=56, gid="ENSG00000141510"> }Only a subset of the attributes in the Genes relation are commonly used in a biomedical analysis.
This can be achieved using the following expression:

sum(<g,v> in Genes) { <gene=g.name,contig=g.contig,start=g.start,end=g.end> }

Inefficiency of Joins. The presented translation for the join operator is inefficient. This is because
one has to consider all combinations of elements of the input relations. In the case of equality joins,
this be improved by leveraging data locality as will be shown in Section 5.3.1.

3.2 Nested Relational Calculus
Relational algebra does not allow nested relations; a relation in the first normal form (1NF) when
none of the attributes is a set of elements [Codd 1970]. Nested relational calculus allows attributes
to be relations as well. In order to make the case more interesting, we consider NRC+ [Koch et al.
2016], a variant of nested relational calculus with bag semantics and without difference operator.
Nested relations are represented as dictionaries mapping each row to their multiplicities. As the
rows can contain other relations, the keys of the outer dictionary can also contain dictionaries.
Figure 5 shows the translation from positive nested relational calculus (without difference) to SDQL.
The explanation on the translation of its constructs can be found in the supplementary material.
Example 4. Consider the Variants input, which contains top-level genomic variants
and nested genotype information for every sample. Genotype calls denoting the number of alternate
alleles in a sample. An example of the nested Variants input is as follows:
