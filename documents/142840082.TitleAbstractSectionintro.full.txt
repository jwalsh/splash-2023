Abstract. We present symbolic methods to improve the precision of
static analyses of modular based on Abstract Inter-
pretation. Like similar symbolic methods, the idea is to simplify on-the-
fly arithmetic expressions before they are given to abstract transfer func-
tions of underlying abstract domains. When manipulating fixed-length
integer data types, casts and overflows like modulo com-
putations which hinder the use of symbolic techniques. The goal of this
article formalize how modulo operations can be safely eliminated by
abstracting arbitrary arithmetic expressions into sum, product, or divi-
