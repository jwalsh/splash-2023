 domain S = (cid:104)sp(cid:105)p∈[X ]2, and a collection S1 = (cid:104)s(cid:48)

Algorithm 2 for the collection S(cid:48) = (cid:104)sp(cid:105)p∈[X ]2,(p(cid:54)⊆V ∨|p|(cid:54)=2) ∪ S1 Let ¯s =(cid:100) S(cid:48) the
p(cid:48) (cid:118) sp(cid:48) for all p(cid:48). Assume that (cid:104)tp(cid:105)p∈[X ]2 is the collection of values returned by
s(cid:48)
abstract relation represented by S(cid:48). Then for each p ∈ [X ]2,
1. ¯s|p (cid:118) tp;
2. If the 2-decomposable domain R is 2-projective, then ¯s|p = tp holds. In that

case, (cid:104)tp(cid:105)p∈[X ]2 is the greatest solution of constraint system (8).

Proof. Let p ∈ [X ]2. ¯s|p (cid:118) tp holds since, as observed before, all right-hand sides
of the constraint system (8) are monotonic and the individual update steps of
Algorithm 2 each correspond to updates performed by the evaluations of the
right-hand sides of (8). Thus, the ﬁrst statement follows.

Now consider the case where the relational domain is additionally 2-projective.
The invariant which the non-incremental Algorithm 1 attains after the initializa-
tion holds by construction here. Let t(r)
p denote the value of tp attained after the
iteration of the second loop for the r-th variable in the non-incremental Algo-
rithm 1. We choose the order of the iteration of variables in the second loop such

that the variables in V are considered last. Then, for the ﬁrst |X \ V | iterations
t(r−1)
p, as the original collection (cid:104)sp(cid:105)p∈[X ]2 was normalized. Therefore, it
suﬃces to execute the last |V | iterations of the second loop of Algorithm 1 which
(cid:117)(cid:116)
is identical to Algorithm 2. Thus, by Theorem 1, the claim follows.
We have thus shown that re-establishing normalization (and thus closure) after
adding octagon constraints for m variables is in O(m · n2).

6 Abstract Transformers for Linear Assignments
Assume we are given a normalized value r over the set X of program variables
from some 2-decomposable relational domain. Assume further that we are given
an assignment a of the form x ← e where e is an expression over some subset
V ⊆ X, and assume that the relational domain satisﬁes3) and (4).
Let r ∈ R denote the relational value before the assignment and assume r is
already normalized where rp = r|p has already been computed for all p [X ]2.
Let r(cid:48) =(cid:74)a(cid:75)(cid:93) r denote the relational value after the assignment. Then, for every
p ∈ [X ]2 with x (cid:54)∈ p, r(cid:48)|p|p = rp. In order to compute the of
p = r(cid)|p for x ∈ p, i.e., a linear
r(cid:48), it therefore suﬃces to compute the values r(cid:48)
number of clusters p. Now consider some variable y ∈ X. Because of property
(4), we have that

r(cid:48)

p =(cid:74)a(cid:75)(cid:93)r(cid:12)(cid:12){x,y}
= ((cid:74)a(cid:75)(cid:93)r|V ∪{x,y})
= ((cid:74)a(c75)(cid:93)((cid:rp | p ⊆ V ∪ {x, y}}))(cid:cid:12){x,y}
{x,y} requires taking into account only clusters p ∈ [X ]2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12){x,y}

i.e., the abstract value r(cid:48)
 from V ∪ {x, y}. We conclude:
Proposition 4. Assume that computations on abstract relations from R over
a bounded set of variables is constant time, and assume that the assignment a
refers only to a bounded number of variables. Assume further that the abstract
(cid:117)(cid:116)

relation r ∈ R is normalized. Then a normalization of the relationid:74)a(cid:75)(cid:93)r can be

computed in linear time.

7 Linear Programming with Octagon Constraints

Let us turn to the implementation of best abstract transformers for assignments
for the octagon domain (over rationals as well as over integers). For the octagon
domain, an abstract transformer for assignments can be constructed by adding
octagon constraints. This works well for right-hand sides of the form y + c or
−y + c for variables y and constants c. For more general right-hand sides such
as, e.g., 3 · y − 2 · z, the best transformer can instead be expressed by means of
optimization problems [25].

When interpreted over the rationals, optimal solutions can be computed in time
polynomial in the size of the linear program (i.e., the number of bits to spell it
out) [15] or exponential time in the number of variables if simplex type algo-
rithms are used [17]. To this general approach, we here add one more observation,
namely, that over the rationals, the set of octagon constraints to be satisﬁed in
optimization problems can be restricted to constraints where each occurring vari-
able z ∈ V occurs with the same sign as the coeﬃcient az of z in the objective
function: this considerably reduces the number of constraints to be considered.
Proposition 5. Assume that we are given the rational octagon linear program
(13) where az > 0 for all z ∈ V. If the octagon corresponding to the constraints
is closed, then the same result is obtained when the constraints are restricted to
