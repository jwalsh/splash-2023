This section describes the Questionnaire Language (QL), a DSL for expressing interactive questionnaires. It focuses on the liveness properties and trickle effects at the heart of its semantics. It explains that forms consist of sequences of two kinds of statements: questions and if statements. Questions consist of a textual message, a question type (int, str or bool), and a variable name that can be used to reference the question's answer. By default, questions are answerable, but when assigned with an expression, they become computed. If statements are conditionals that can be used to control the flow of the form. They can be used to make questions answerable or unanswerable, depending on the answer to a previous question. Finally, the section provides an example of a form that calculates an age-dependent discount.
