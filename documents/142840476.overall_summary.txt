It provides an example of the Pairs domain, which is 2-decomposable but not 2-projective, and an example of the rational and integer octagons, which are both 2-decomposable and 2-projective. It then discusses the use of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to incrementally compute 2-normal forms when clusters with two variables have potentially received new values. The paper also presents an algorithm for normalizing octagon abstract relations over rationals and integers, introducing the notion of 2-decomposability for relational domains and providing a cubic-time algorithm based on Floyd-Warshall which overapproximates normalization. It also provides a quadratic algorithm for incremental normalization and reconsiders the construction of best abstract transformers for affine assignments by means of linear programming. The paper also discusses the weakly relational numerical domain of Octagons and related work, and provides a proof of Proposition 3 and a proof of the proposition that linear combinations z and z + y for z, y ∈ V and z = y can be attained by a feasible solution y(cid:96), (cid:96) ∈ L. Finally, it investigates whether extensions to the Octagon domain and the domain of difference bounds proposed in the literature are 2-decomposable and 2-projective. Theorem 2 states that if a 2-normal collection of values of some 2-decomposable and 2-projective relational domain is given, then normalization can be computed incrementally.
