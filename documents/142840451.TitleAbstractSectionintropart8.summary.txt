This section discusses the transition system used to construct an on-demand call graph. It is non-deterministic, meaning that multiple rules can be applied in any order to reach an overapproximation of the relevant parts of the real. The authors prove soundness of the approach by stating that once the algorithm reaches a fixed point, the call graph is on-demand sound with respect to the answered queries. The transition system is composed of five rules: AddFwdCallEdge, AddBwdCallEdge, ReachedCallFwds, ReachedCallBwds, ReachedEnterBwds, and ReachedExitFwds. The proof of soundness is presented in four steps: defining an intermediate collecting semantics, proving that the transition system overapproximates the intermediate collecting semantics, showing that a fixed point of the intermediate collecting semantics approximates all subtraces for the queries that were generated, and finally proving that the call graph is on-demand sound.
