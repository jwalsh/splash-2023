This section discusses the limitations and future work of the debugger proposed in the paper. It also provides an overview of related work in the field of debugging interpreters and static analysis implementations. The authors propose cross-level debugging for static analysis implementations, which moves stepping and breakpoints from the base level to the meta level. They also propose domain-specific visualisations for visually depicting the current state of the analysis, and domain-specific conditional breakpoints which enable developers to suspend the analysis when certain conditions are met. As future work, the authors suggest additional breakpoints that express properties on the dependency graph and the set of seen components, language extensions and extensions to the predicate evaluator to allow developers to keep track of an arbitrary state between the evaluation of breakpoints, and the integration of their debugger with an Integrated Development Environment.
