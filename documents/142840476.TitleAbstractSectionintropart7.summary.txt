This section discusses Algorithm 1, a variant of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute (an overapproximation of) normalization. It consists of one application of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, as is, and an initialization round to ensure that each value t{x} not only subsumes s{x}, but also s{x} and s{y}. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(n3) if calculations with abstract relations over at most three variables can be performed in constant time. Theorem 1 states that for each p ∈ [X ]2, ¯s|p (cid:118) tp and if the 2-decomposable domain R is 2-projective, then ¯s|p = tp holds. In that case, (cid:104)tp(cid:105)p∈[X ]2 is the greatest solution of the constraint system (8). Thus, Algorithm 1 provides a cubic time normalization procedure – whenever R is 2-decomposable and 2-projective.
