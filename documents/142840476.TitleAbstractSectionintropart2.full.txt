 the sub-space deﬁned
by Y, combined with arbitrary values for variables z (cid:54)∈ Y. The abstract eﬀect
of a guard c onto a given conjunction r can as r ∧ c = r ∧ (c ∧ r|V )
if c is a linear equality or inequality, respectively, using variables from V. The
abstract eﬀect of an assignment x ← e with aﬃne right-hand side e, ﬁnally, can
be reduced to the addition of new constraints and projection onto sub-spaces.
Relational domains may also be constructed for non-numerical values, e.g., by
(cid:117)(cid:116)
maintaining ﬁnite subsets of value maps.

3 Weakly Relational Domains

One way to tackle the high cost of relational domains is to track relationships
not between all variables, but only between subclusters of variables. We call such
domains Weakly Relational Domains.
For a subset Y ⊆ X, let RY = {r | r ∈ R, r|Y = r} the set of all abstract
values from R that contain only information on those variables in Y. For any

collection S ⊆ 2X of clusters of variables, a relation r ∈ R can be approximated
by a meet of relationsY, Y ∈ S since for every r ∈ R,

r (cid:118)(cid:100){r|Y | Y ∈ S}

holds. Schwarz et al. [26] introduce the notion of 2-decomposable relational do-
mains. These are domains where the full value can be recovered from the restric-
tion to all clusters [X ]2 of variables of size at most 2, and all ﬁn upper
bounds can be recovered by computing within these clusters only, i.e., where
