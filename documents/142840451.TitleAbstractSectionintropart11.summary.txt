This section discusses the motivation for the authors' work and compares it to other approaches. It explains that the authors' approach is parameterized and provides strong soundness guarantees, while other approaches sacrifice soundness in order to achieve scalability. It also mentions that the authors' approach is inspired by Datalog-based analyses, but that Datalog analyses do not typically allow for plugging in another points-to analysis instead. The section then concludes with a discussion of the authors' prototype Merlin, which is evaluated on a synthetic benchmark set. The results indicate that on-demand call graph construction has the potential to improve scalability by only exploring the relevant part of programs in the benchmark. Finally, the section provides single-threaded performance results, which demonstrate that the faster whole-program results are caused by better CPU utilization.
