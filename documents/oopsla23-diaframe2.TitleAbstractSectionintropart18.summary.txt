This section compares the proof automation of Diaframe 2.0 to Voila, a proof outline checker for logical atomicity, and to existing interactive proofs done in ReLoC. It evaluates the proof automation on four sets of benchmarks. In comparison with Voila, Diaframe 2.0 has ca. 0.4 lines of proof burden per line of implementation, while Voila has 1.7 lines of proof burden per line of implementation. For 6 out of the 9 examples, the logically atomic triples can be veriﬁed by Diaframe 2.0 without any help from the user. This shows that Diaframe 2.0 achieves Design goal #1—full automation for ‘simple’ proofs of logical atomicity. The other three examples require some help for arithmetic modulo  (bounded counter), case distinctions which need to be performed at a speci�c place in the proof (ticket lock and bag stack), or custom hints with non-automatable proofs (bag stack). The section also compares Diaframe 2.0 to existing interactive proofs done in ReLoC.
