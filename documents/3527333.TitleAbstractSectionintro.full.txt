This paper introduces semi-ring dictionaries, a powerful class of compositional and purely functional collections
that subsume other collection types such as sets, multisets, arrays, vectors, and matrices. We developed SDQL,
a statically typed language that can express relational algebra with aggregations, linear algebra, and functional
collections over data such as relations and matrices using semi-ring dictionaries. Furthermore, thanks to the
algebraic structure behind these dictionaries, SDQL unifies a wide range of optimizations commonly used
in databases (DB) and linear algebra (LA). As a result, SDQL enables efficient processing of hybrid DB and
LA workloads, by putting together optimizations that are otherwise confined to either DB systems or LA
frameworks. We show experimentally that a handful of DB and LA workloads can take advantage of the SDQL
language and optimizations. SDQL can be competitive with or outperforms a host of systems
