Abstract
This paper investigates the adaptation of session types to provide behavioural information about
Elixir modules. We devise a type system, called ElixirST, which statically determines whether
functions in an Elixir module observe their endpoint specifications, expressed as session types;
a corresponding tool automating this typechecking has also been constructed. In this paper we
also formally validate this type system. An LTS-based operational semantics for the language
fragment supported by the type system is developed, modelling its runtime behaviour when inter-
acting with the module client. This operational semantics is then used to prove a form of session
fidelity and progress for ElixirST.
