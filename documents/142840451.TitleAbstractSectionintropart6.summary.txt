This section provides a formal definition of the language of events used to model program semantics. It defines a set of events (call, enter, exit, return, ref) and a set of traces (Eventâˆ— = Trace). It also defines a set of restrictions on traces to exclude ill-formed traces that could not be generated by a real program. It then introduces two kinds of call graph queries (callee query and caller query) and defines complete backward subtraces with both start and end points.
