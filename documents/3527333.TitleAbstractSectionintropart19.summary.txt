This section reviews the literature related to SDQL, a functional collection programming language with semi-ring dictionaries. It compares different data analytics approaches and SDQL, and discusses relational query engines and nested data models. Relational query engines have been heavily investigated in the DB community, and vectorized query engines process blocks of data to remove interpretation overhead. Nested relational models and monad calculus have also been explored. SDQL is shown to have superior performance over competitors such as LMFAO, MorpheusPy, and NumPy for computing the covariance matrix over normalized matrix. It is also shown to have a better performance than MorpheusPy and NumPy for relations with the same number of features, and a superior performance for SDQL once the curried representation is used.
