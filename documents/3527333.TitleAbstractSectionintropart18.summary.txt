This section compares the performance of SDQL and taco for three higher-order tensor workloads on the NELL-2 dataset. It is observed that SDQL is faster than taco, especially for medium range of sparsity, with speedups ranging from 1.4x to 23x. For sparser scenarios, taco shows better performance (up to 1.3x). The section then considers hybrid workloads that involve linear algebra processing, using nested and relational data. For nested data, SDQL is observed to be faster than Trance/MLLib, with speedups of up to one order of magnitude. For relational data, SDQL is observed to be faster than LMFAO, with speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.
