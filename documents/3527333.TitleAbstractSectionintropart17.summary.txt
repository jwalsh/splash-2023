This section discusses the experimental results of SDQL for online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads used in databases and linear algebra workloads. The experiments were run on a iMac equipped with an Intel Core i5 CPU running at 2.7GHz, 32GB of DDR3 RAM with OS X 10.13.6. The results of the experiments showed that the row layout for input relations had a 4.2x speedup over the standard dictionary layout, and the columnar improved the performance by 1.5x. For linear algebra workloads, using curried representation can provide asymptotic improvements over the na√Øve representation, and performing fusion can provide 2x speedup on average. The usage of dense representation (by NumPy) can provide better implementations as the matrix becomes more dense; however, for smaller densities, sparse representations (by SciPy and SDQL) can be up to two orders of magnitude faster.
