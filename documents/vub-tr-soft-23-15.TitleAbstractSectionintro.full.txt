Static analyses provide the foundation for several tools that
help developers find problems before executing the program analysis. Common applications include warning about
unused code, deprecated API calls, or about potential security
vulnerabilities within an A static analysis distinguishes
itself from a dynamic analysis in that it is supposed to termi-
nate even if the analysis does not. In many
cases it is also desired for the analysis to be sound, meaning
that its answers account for all possible program behavior.
Unfortunately, analysis developers may make mistakes that
violate these properties resulting in hard-find bugs in the
analysis. Finding these bugs can be a,
especially since analysis developers have
